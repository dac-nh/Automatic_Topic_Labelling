1|Performance Analysis Of Distributed Database Recovery Protocols|An early recovery protocol that was investigated at length and is currently implemented in most commercial Distributed Database Management System products is the two-phase commit protocol. However, there is one main drawback in using this, namely blocking, that is, operational sites having to wait for the recovery of a failed site in order to complete a transaction. The two-phase commit protocol continues to be implemented in commercial Distributed Database Management System products even though alternatives to it have been developed to alleviate the blocking drawback. The alternatives are the three-phase commit protocol and a vendor developed replication technology. A critical and systematic analysis of these recovery protocols was conducted to determine the justification for continuing to implement the two-phase commit protocol in current commercial Distributed Database Management System products. This paper will present the results of the critical analysis. 1. 
2|Nonblocking Commit Protocols|&amp;quot;From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached.&amp;quot; Kafka Protocols that allow operational sites to continue transac-tion processing even though site failures have occurred are called nonblocking. Many applications require nonblocking Qrotocols. This paper investigates the properties of non-blocking protocols. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a protocol to be nonblocking are presented and from these conditions a method for designing them is derived. Both a central site nonblocking protocol and a decentralized non-blocking protocol are presented.
3|A Formal Model of Crash Recovery in a Distributed Systems|Abstract-A formal model for atomic commit protocols for a distributed database system is introduced. The model is used to prove existence results about resilient protocols for site failures that do not partition the network and then for partitioned networks. For site failures, a pessimistic recovery technique, called independent recovery, is introduced and the class of failures for which resilient protocols exist is identified. For partitioned networks, two cases are studied: the pessimistic case in which messages are lost, and the optimistic case in which no messages are lost. In all cases, fundamental limitations on the resiliency of protocols are derived. Index Tenns-Commit protocols, crash recovery, distributed database systems, distributed systems, fault tolerance, transaction management. I.
4|Distributed Database Systems |this article, we discuss the fundamentals of distributed DBMS technology. We address the data distribution and architectural design issues as well as the algorithms that need to be implemented to provide the basic DBMS functions such as query processing, concurrency control, reliability, and replication control.
5|DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS|Growth of distributed systems has attained unstoppable momentum. If we better understood how to think about, analyze, and design distributed systems, we could direct their implementation with more confidence.

7|Induction of Decision Trees| The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.  
8|A Theory of the Learnable|  Humans appear to be able to learn new concepts without needing to be programmed explicitly in any conventional sense. In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems.
9|Learning logical definitions from relations| This paper describes FOIL, a system that learns Horn clauses from data expressed as relations. FOIL is based on ideas that have proved effective in attribute-value learning systems, but extends them to a first-order formalism. This new system has been applied successfully to several tasks taken from the machine learning literature.
10|Knowledge acquisition via incremental conceptual clustering|hill climbing Abstract. Conceptual clustering is an important way of summarizing and explaining data. However, the recent formulation of this paradigm has allowed little exploration of conceptual clustering as a means of improving performance. Furthermore, previous work in conceptual clustering has not explicitly dealt with constraints imposed by real world environments. This article presents COBWEB, a conceptual clustering system that organizes data so as to maximize inference ability. Additionally, COBWEB is incremental and computationally economical, and thus can be flexibly applied in a variety of domains. 1.
11|Querying object-oriented databases|We present a novel language for querying object-oriented databases. The language is built around the idea of extended path expressions that substantially generalize [ZAN83], and on an adaptation of the first-order formalization of object-oriented languages from [KW89, KLW90, KW92]. The language incorporates features not found in earlier proposals; it is easier to use and has greater expressive power. Some of the salient features of our language are: ffl Precise model-theoretic semantics. ffl A very expressive form of path expressions that not only can do joins, selections and unnesting, but can also be used to explore the database schema. ffl Views can be defined and manipulated in a much more uniform way than in other proposals. ffl Database schema can be explored in the very same language that is used to retrieve data. Unlike in relational languages, the user needs not know anything about the system tables that store schema information. ffl The notions of a type and type-correctness have precise meaning. It accommodates a wide variety of queries that might be deemed well- or ill-typed under different circumstances. In particular, we show that there is more than one way of settling the issue of type correctness. For expository purposes and due to space limitation, we chose to make a number of simplifying assumptions and left some features out. A more complete account can be found in [KSK92].
12|Pfam protein families database |Pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile hidden Markov models. The current release of Pfam (22.0) contains 9318 protein families. Pfam is now based not only on the UniProtKB sequence database, but also on NCBI GenPept and on sequences from selected metage-nomics projects. Pfam is available on the web from the consortium members using a new, consistent and improved website design in the UK
13|What is a hidden Markov model?|Often, problems in biological sequence analysis are just a matter of putting the right label on each residue. In gene identification, we want to label nucleotides as exons, introns, or intergenic sequence. In sequence alignment, we want to associate residues in a query sequence with ho-mologous residues in a target database sequence. We can always write an ad hoc program for any given problem, but the same potentially frustrating issues will always recur. One issue is that we often want to incorporate multiple heterogenous sources of information. A genefinder, for in-stance, ought to combine splice site consenses, codon bias, exon/intron length preferences, and open reading frame analysis all in one scoring system. How should all those parameters be set? How should different kinds of information be weighted? A second issue is being able to interpret results probabilistically. Finding a best scoring answer is one thing, but what does the score mean, and how confident are we that the best answer, or any given part of it, is correct? A third issue is extensibility. The moment we perfect our ad hoc genefinder, we wish we had also modeled translational initiation consensus, alternative splicing, and a polyadenylation signal. All too often, piling more reality onto a fragile ad hoc program makes it collapse under its own weight. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a formal foundation for making probabilistic models of
14|The Pfam protein families database|Pfam is a large collection of protein families and domains. Over the past 2 years the number of families in Pfam has doubled and now stands at 6190 (version 10.0). Methodology improvements for searching the Pfam collection locally as well as via the web are described. Other recent innovations include modelling of discontinuous domains allow-ing Pfam domain de®nitions to be closer to those found in structure databases. Pfam is available on the web in the UK
15|Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information|In addition to maintaining the GenBankÒ nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBIs Web site. NCBI resources include Entrez,
16|Hidden Markov models in computational biology: applications to protein modeling|Hidden.Markov Models (HMMs) are applied t.0 the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated the on globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the. SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences. that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The Hi &#034; produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate threedimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the &#039;\ HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appecvs to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false
17|Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison|Motivation: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction, and evolution. Results: We have generalized the alignment of protein se-quences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER, and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF_SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all compari-son of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20%. Sensitivity: When predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF_SIM for a rate of false positives of 10%. Approxi-mately half of the improvement over the profileprofile com-parison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an in-creased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7, and 3.3 times more good alignments (balanced  score&gt; 0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9, and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, super-family, and fold level. Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33s on an AMD64 3GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF_SIM and 17 times faster than
18|Pfam: clans, web tools and services|Pfam is a database of protein families that currently contains 7973 entries (release 18.0). A recent development in Pfam has enabled the grouping of related families into clans. Pfam clans are described in detail, together with the new associated web pages. Improvements to the range of Pfam web tools and the first set of Pfam web services that allow programmatic access to the database and associated tools are also presented. Pfam is available on the web in the UK
19|SCOP database in 2004: refinements integrate structure and sequence family data|The Structural Classication of Proteins (SCOP) database is a comprehensive ordering of all proteins of known structure, according to their evolutionary and structural relationships. Protein domains in SCOP are hierarchically classied into families, superfamilies, folds and classes. The continual accumulation of sequence and structural data allows more rigorous analysis and provides important information for understanding the protein world and its evolutionary repertoire. SCOP participates in a project that aims to rationalize and integrate the data on proteins held in several sequence and structure databases. As part of this project, starting with release 1.63, we have initiated a renement of the SCOP classication, which introduces a number of changes mostly at the levels below superfamily. The pending SCOP reclassication will be carried out gradually through a number of future releases. In addition to the expanded set of static links to external resources, available at the level of domain entries, we have started modernization of the interface capabilities of SCOP allowing more dynamic links with other databases. SCOP can be accessed at http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop.
20|A combined transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction method|Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to the tasks of transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction. In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions. We report a relative improvement of 13 % over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We also show that our confidence metrics correlate well with the observed precision. In addition, we have made predictions on all 6.3 million proteins in the Yeast Resource Center (YRC) database. This large-scale study provides an overall picture of the relative numbers of proteins that include a signal-peptide and/or one or more transmembrane segments as well as a valuable resource for the scientific community. All DBNs are implemented using the Graphical Models Toolkit. Source code for the models described here is available at
21|The Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling expedition: Expanding the universe of protein families. PLoS Biol 5: e16|Metagenomics projects based on shotgun sequencing of populations of micro-organisms yield insight into protein families. We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in

23|The pairwise energy content estimated from amino acid composition discriminates between folded and intrinsically unstructured proteins|Intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins/ domains (IUPs), such as p21, 1 the N-terminal domain of p53 2 or the transactivator domain of CREB, 3 exist in a largely disordered structural state,
24|A NEW GENERATION OF HOMOLOGY SEARCH TOOLS BASED ON PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE|Many theoretical advances have been made in applying probabilistic inference methods to improve the power of sequence homology searches, yet the BLAST suite of programs is still the workhorse for most of the field. The main reason for this is practical: BLASTs programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the HMMER software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in HMMER3 is to achieve BLASTs speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. HMMER3 implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to BLAST. The HMMER project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.
25|Accelerated Profile HMM Searches|Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the multiple segment Viterbi  (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call sparse rescaling. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.
26|FastTree 2 -- Approximately Maximum-Likelihood Trees for Large Alignments|Background: We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximumlikelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the CAT  approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 1001,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance: FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments.

29|A: Pfam 10 years on: 10,000 families and still growing |Classifications of proteins into groups of related sequences are in some respects like a periodic table for biology, allowing us to understand the underlying molecular biology of any organism. Pfam is a large collection of protein domains and families. Its scientific goal is to provide a complete and accurate classification of protein families and domains. The next release of the database will contain over 10 000 entries, which leads us to reflect on how far we are from completing this work. Currently Pfam matches 72 % of known protein sequences, but for proteins with known structure Pfam matches 95%, which we believe represents the likely upper bound. Based on our analysis a further 28 000 families would be required to achieve this level of coverage for the current sequence database.We also show that as more sequences are added to the sequence databases the fraction of sequences that Pfam matches is reduced, suggesting that continued addition of new families is essential to maintain its relevance.
30|Representative proteomes: a stable, scalable and unbiased proteome set for sequence analysis and functional annotation. PLoS One 6: e18910|The accelerating growth in the number of protein sequences taxes both the computational and manual resources needed to analyze them. One approach to dealing with this problem is to minimize the number of proteins subjected to such analysis in a way that minimizes loss of information. To this end we have developed a set of Representative Proteomes (RPs), each selected from a Representative Proteome Group (RPG) containing similar proteomes calculated based on co-membership in UniRef50 clusters. A Representative Proteome is the proteome that can best represent all the proteomes in its group in terms of the majority of the sequence space and information. RPs at 75%, 55%, 35 % and 15 % co-membership threshold (CMT) are provided to allow users to decrease or increase the granularity of the sequence space based on their requirements. We find that a CMT of 55 % (RP55) most closely follows standard taxonomic classifications. Further analysis of this set reveals that sequence space is reduced by more than 80 % relative to UniProtKB, while retaining both sequence diversity (over 95 % of InterPro domains) and annotation information (93 % of experimentally characterized proteins). All sets can be browsed and are available for sequence similarity searches and download at
31|Functional evaluation of domaindomain interactions and human protein interaction networks|Abstract: Large amounts of protein and domain interaction data are being produced by experimental high-throughput techniques and computational approaches. To gain insight into the value of the provided data, we used our new similarity measure based on the Gene Ontology to evaluate the molecular functions and biological processes of interacting proteins or domains. The applied measure particularly addresses the frequent annotation of proteins or domains with multiple Gene Ontology terms. Using our similarity measure, we compare predicted domain-domain and human protein-protein interactions with experimentally derived interactions. The results show that our similarity measure is of significant benefit in quality assessment and confidence ranking of domain and protein networks. We also derive useful confidence score thresholds for dividing domain interaction predictions into subsets of low and high confidence. 1
32|Control of protein functional dynamics by peptide linkers |Abstract: Control of structural flexibility is essential for the proper functioning of a large number of proteins and multiprotein complexes. At the residue level, such flexibility occurs due to local relaxation of peptide bond angles whose cumulative effect may result in large changes in the secon-dary, tertiary or quaternary structures of protein molecules. Such flexibility, and its absence, most often depends on the nature of interdomain linkages formed by oligopeptides. Both flexible and rela-tively rigid peptide linkers are found in many multidomain proteins. Linkers are thought to control favorable and unfavorable interactions between adjacent domains by means of variable softness furnished by their primary sequence. Large-scale structural heterogeneity of multidomain proteins and their complexes, facilitated by soft peptide linkers, is now seen as the norm rather than the exception. Biophysical discoveries as well as computational algorithms and databases have reshaped our understanding of the often spectacular biomolecular dynamics enabled by soft linkers. Absence of such motion, as in so-called molecular rulers, also has desirable functional effects in protein architecture. We review here the historic discovery and current understanding of the nature of domains and their linkers from a structural, computational, and biophysical point of view. A number of emerging applications, based on the current understanding of the structural properties
33|Unfoldomics of Human Genetic Diseases: Illustrative Examples of Ordered and Intrinsically Disordered Members of the Human Diseasome |Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitute a recently recognized realm of atypical biologically active proteins that lack stable structure under physiological conditions, but are commonly involved in such crucial cellular processes as regulation, recognition, signaling and control. IDPs are very common among proteins associated with various diseases. Recently, we performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis of the human diseasome, a network that linked the human disease phenome (which includes all the human genetic diseases) with the human disease genome (which contains
34|LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation|  We seek to build a large collection of images with ground truth labels to be used for object detection and recognition research. Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.
35|The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory| Statistical learning theory was introduced in the late 1960s. Until the 1990s it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990s new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems. A more
36|Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features|This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the &#034;Integral Image&#034; which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a &#034;cascade&#034; which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.
37|Color indexing|Computer vision is embracing a new research focus in which the aim is to develop visual skills for robots that allow them to interact with a dynamic, realistic environment. To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot&#039;s goals. Two fundamental goals are determin-ing the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks. This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for index-ing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique called Histogram Intersection, which matches model and im-age histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm called Histogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes. 1
38|Modeling the Shape of the Scene: A Holistic Representation of the Spatial Envelope|In this paper, we propose a computational model of the recognition of real world scenes that bypasses the segmentation and the processing of individual objects or regions. The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category.
39|Object class recognition by unsupervised scale-invariant learning|We present a method to learn and recognize object class models from unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes in a scale invariant manner. Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals). 1.
40|A bayesian hierarchical model for learning natural scene categories|We propose a novel approach to learn and recognize natural scene categories. Unlike previous work [9, 17], it does not require experts to annotate the training set. We represent the image of a scene by a collection of local regions, denoted as codewords obtained by unsupervised learning. Each region is represented as part of a theme. In previous work, such themes were learnt from hand-annotations of experts, while our method learns the theme distributions as well as the codewords distribution over the themes without supervision. We report satisfactory categorization performances on a large set of 13 categories of complex scenes. 1.
41|Learning generative visual models from few training examples: an incremental Bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories|Abstract  Current computational approaches to learning visual object categories require thousands of training images, are slow, cannot learn in an incremental manner and cannot incorporate prior information into the learning process. In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum-likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets. I.
42|Labeling Images with a Computer Game|We introduce a new interactive system: a game that is fun and can be used to create valuable output. When people  play the game they help determine the contents of images  by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is  played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the  Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users  block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don&#039;t work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained.
43|Photo tourism: Exploring photo collections in 3D|Figure 1: Our system takes unstructured collections of photographs such as those from online image searches (a) and reconstructs 3D points and viewpoints (b) to enable novel ways of browsing the photos (c). We present a system for interactively browsing and exploring large unstructured collections of photographs of a scene using a novel 3D interface. Our system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing sites.
44|Matching words and pictures|We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmanns hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation
45|The 2005 pascal visual object classes challenge|Abstract. The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge ran from February to March 2005. The goal of the challenge was to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes (i.e. not pre-segmented objects). Four object classes were selected: motorbikes, bicycles, cars and people. Twelve teams entered the challenge. In this chapter we provide details of the datasets, algorithms used by the teams, evaluation criteria, and results achieved. 1
46|Combined Object Categorization and Segmentation With An Implicit Shape Model|We present a method for object categorization in real-world scenes. Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure-ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automatically segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made possible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both capabilities into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a natural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in different articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion.
47|Learning to detect objects in images via a sparse, part-based representation| We study the problem of detecting objects in still, grayscale images. Our primary focus is development of a learning-based approach to the problem, that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented.
48|One-shot learning of object categories| Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of training examples. We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully.
49|Using Multiple Segmentations to Discover Objects and their Extent in Image Collections |Given a large dataset of images, we seek to automatically determine the visually similar object and scene classes together with their image segmentation. To achieve this we combine two ideas: (i) that a set of segmented objects can be partitioned into visual object classes using topic discovery models from statistical text analysis; and (ii) that visual object classes can be used to assess the accuracy of a segmentation. To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations. We demonstrate that such an algorithm succeeds in automatically discovering many familiar objects in a variety of image datasets, including those from Caltech, MSRC and LabelMe. 1.
50|Learning object categories from googles image search|Current approaches to object category recognition require datasets of training images to be manually prepared, with varying degrees of supervision. We present an approach that can learn an object category from just its name, by uti-lizing the raw output of image search engines available on the Internet. We develop a new model, TSI-pLSA, which extends pLSA (as applied to visual words) to include spa-tial information in a translation and scale invariant man-ner. Our approach can handle the high intra-class vari-ability and large proportion of unrelated images returned by search engines. We evaluate the models on standard test sets, showing performance competitive with existing meth-ods trained on hand prepared datasets. 1.
51|Sharing Features: Efficient Boosting Procedures for Multiclass Object Detection|We consider the problem of detecting a large number of different object classes in cluttered scenes. Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges.
52|Putting objects in perspective|Image understanding requires not only individually estimating elements of the visual world but also capturing the interplay among them. In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach. 1.
53|Object categorization by learned universal visual dictionary|Figure 1: Exemplar snapshots of our interactive object categorization demo application. A user selects (sloppily) a region of interest and our algorithm associates an object class label with it. Despite large differences in pose, size, illumination and visual appearance the correct class label (e.g. cow, building, car...) is automatically associated with each selected object instance. Some of these test images were downloaded from the web and none were part of the training set. A video of the interactive demo may be found at the above web site. This paper presents a new algorithm for the automatic recognition of object classes from images (categorization). Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is two fold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes). 1.
54|Contextual Priming for Object Detection|There is general consensus that context can be a rich source of information about an object&#039;s identity, location and scale. In fact, the structure of many real-world scenes is governed by strong configurational rules akin to those that apply to a single object. Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes.
56|Learning methods for generic object recognition with invariance to pose and lighting|We assess the applicability of several popular learning methods for the problem of recognizing generic visual categories with invariance to pose, lighting, and surrounding clutter. A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 angles, 9 azimuths, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest Neighbor methods, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13 % for SVM and 7 % for Convolutional Nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while Convolutional nets yielded 14 % error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second. 1
57|Analyzing Appearance and Contour Based Methods for Object Categorization|Object recognition has reached a level where we can identify a large number of previously seen and known objects. However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods.
58|A Bayesian approach to unsupervised one-shot learning of object categories|Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires thousands of training examples; this is due to the diversity and richness of object appearance which requires models containing hundreds of parameters. We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (  ? ?). It is based on incorporating generic knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and prior  knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior  model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a prior  is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images. 1.
59|Learning hierarchical models of scenes, objects, and parts|We describe a hierarchical probabilistic model for the detection and recognition of objects in cluttered, natural scenes. The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical models structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects. 1.
60|Peekaboom: A Game for Locating Objects in Images|We introduce Peekaboom, an entertaining web-based game that can help computers locate objects in images. People play the game because of its entertainment value, and as a side effect of them playing, we collect valuable image metadata, such as which pixels belong to which object in the image. The collected data could be applied towards constructing more accurate computer vision algorithms, which require massive amounts of training and testing data not currently available. Peekaboom has been played by thousands of people, some of whom have spent over 12 hours a day playing, and thus far has generated millions of data points. In addition to its purely utilitarian aspect, Peekaboom is an example of a new, emerging class of games, which not only bring people together for leisure purposes, but also exist to improve artificial intelligence. Such games appeal to a general audience, while providing answers to problems that computers cannot yet solve. Author Keywords Distributed knowledge acquisition, object segmentation,
61|Interleaved object categorization and segmentation|Historically, figure-ground segmentation has been seen as an important and even necessary precursor for object recognition. In that context, segmentation is mostly defined as a data driven, that is bottom-up, process. As for humans object recognition and segmentation are heavily intertwined processes, it has been argued that top-down knowledge from object recognition can and should be used for guiding the segmentation process. In this paper, we present a method for the categorization of unfamiliar objects in difficult real-world scenes. The method generates object hypotheses without prior segmentation that can be used to obtain a category-specific figure-ground segmentation. In particular, the proposed approach uses a probabilistic formulation to incorporate knowledge about the recognized category as well as the supporting information in the image to segment the object from the background. This segmentation can then be used for hypothesis verification, to further improve recognition performance. Experimental results show the capacity of the approach to categorize and segment object categories as diverse as cars and cows. 1
62|A boundaryfragment-model for object detection|Abstract. The objective of this work is the detection of object classes, such as airplanes or horses. Instead of using a model based on salient image fragments, we show that object class detection is also possible using only the objects boundary. To this end, we develop a novel learning technique to extract class-discriminative boundary fragments. In addition to their shape, these codebook  entries also determine the objects centroid (in the manner of Leibe et al. [19]). Boosting is used to select discriminative combinations of boundary fragments (weak detectors) to form a strong Boundary-Fragment-Model  (BFM) detector. The generative aspect of the model is used to determine an approximate segmentation. We demonstrate the following results: (i) the BFM detector is able to represent and detect object classes principally defined by their shape, rather than their appearance; and (ii) in comparison with other published results on several object classes (airplanes, cars-rear, cows) the BFM detector is able to exceed previous performances, and to achieve this with less supervision (such as the number of training images). 1
63|Towards Automatic Discovery of Object Categories|We propose a method to learn heterogeneous models of object classes for visual recognition. The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization (see the companion paper [11] for details). When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component
64|Generic Object Recognition with Boosting|This paper presents a powerful framework for generic object recognition. Boosting is used as an underlying learning technique. For the first time a combination of various weak classifiers of different types of descriptors is used, which slightly increases the classification result but dramatically improves the stability of a classifier. Besides applying well known techniques to extract salient regions we also present a new segmentation method-Similarity-Measure-Segmentation. This approach delivers segments, which can consist of several disconnected parts. This turns out to be a mighty description of local similarity. With regard to the task of object categorization, Similarity-Measure-Segmentation performs equal or better than current state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. In contrast to previous solutions we aim at handling of complex objects appearing in highly cluttered images. Therefore we have set up a database containing images with the required complexity. On these images we obtain very good classification results of up to 87 % ROC-equal error rate. Focusing the performance on common databases for object recognition our approach outperforms all comparable solutions.
65|Modeling scenes with local descriptors and latent aspects|We present a new approach to model visual scenes in image collections, based on local invariant features and probabilistic latent space models. Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(1) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupervised latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-theart approaches. Second, we show that Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation. 1.
66|Describing visual scenes using transformed dirichlet processes|Motivated by the problem of learning to detect and recognize objects with minimal supervision, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic model for the spatial structure of visual scenes. In contrast with most existing models, our approach captures the intrinsic uncertainty in the number and identity of objects depicted in a given image. Our scene model is based on the transformed Dirichlet process (TDP), a novel extension of the hierarchical DP in which a set of stochastically transformed mixture components are shared between multiple groups of data. For visual scenes, mixture components describe the spatial structure of visual features in an objectcentered coordinate frame, while transformations model the object positions in a particular image. Learning and inference in the TDP, which has many potential applications beyond computer vision, is based on an empirically effective Gibbs sampler. Applied to a dataset of partially labeled street scenes, we show that the TDPs inclusion of spatial structure improves detection performance, and allows unsupervised discovery of object categories. 1
67|A Bootstrapping Algorithm for Learning Linear Models of Object Classes|Flexible models of object classes, based on linear combinations of prototypical images, are capable of matching novel images of the same class and have been shown to be a powerful tool to solve several fundamental vision tasks such as recognition, synthesis and correspondence. The key problem in creating a specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes. The algorithm -- which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models -- is shown to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible model of handwritten digits. 1 Introduction  In recent papers we have introduced a new type of flexible model for images of objects of a certain class. The idea is to represent images of a certain type -- for instance images of frontal faces -- as the linear combination ...
68|Animals on the Web|We demonstrate a method for identifying images containing categories of animals. The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukaris, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, monkey can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically. 
69|Feature Reduction and Hierarchy of Classifiers for Fast Object Detection in Video Images|We present a two-step method to speed-up object detection systems in computer vision that use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as classifiers. In a first step we perform feature reduction by choosing relevant image features according to a measure derived from statistical learning theory. In a second step we build a hierarchy of classifiers. On the bottom level, a simple and fast classifier analyzes the whole image and rejects large parts of the background. On the top level, a slower but more accurate classifier performs the final detection. Experiments with a face detection system show that combining feature reduction with hierarchical classification leads to a speed-up by a factor of 170 with similar classification performance.
70|Consistent Line Clusters for Building Recognition in CBIR|This paper introduces a new mid-level feature, the consistent line cluster, for use in content-based image retrieval. The color, orientation, and spatial features of line segments are exploited to group them into line clusters. The interrelationships among different clusters and the intrarelationships within single clusters are used to recognize and roughly locate buildings in photographic images. Experiments are performed on a database of color images of outdoor scenes.
71|CBCL streetscenes|The Problem: In the StreetScenes project we study how natural scenes can be processed computationally to produce meaningful semantic information, such as the location and properties of certain object classes, actions or interactions of objects, and the nature or category of the scene itself. Previous work suggests that accurate and powerful scene understanding may be built in a hierarchical manner, where less complex detectors first detect the primitive parts of an object (such as the eyes and nose of a face) and the full detector combines lower level outputs into a final detection. Simultaneously, top-down feedback influences the lower levels by providing category level prior information. It is still an open question how feedback works best in these situations, and what role it plays most naturally. This year, the StreetScenes project will be focusing on these inter-layer interactions so as to increase accuracy and speed of the understanding network. Motivation: Intelligent surveillance and scene understanding systems are in high demand in the marketplace for surveillance, both in civilian and municipal markets. Furthermore, it is in the interest of the biological vision community to be exposed to prototypes capable of the types of difficult processing that humans seem to be able to do so effortlessly. Hierarchal detection and recognition systems have been shown to outperform systems which treat the entire object region in a homogeneous way [4]. The street scenes project has produced a single algorithm capable
72|Parallel database systems: the future of high performance database systems|Abstract: Parallel database machine architectures have evolved from the use of exotic hardware to a software parallel dataflow architecture based on conventional shared-nothing hardware. These new designs provide impressive speedup and scaleup when processing relational database queries. This paper reviews the techniques used by such systems, and surveys current commercial and research systems. 1.
73|Access path selection in a relational database management system|ABSTRACT: In a high level query and data manipulation language such as SQL, requests are stated non-procedurally, without reference to access paths. This paper describes how System R chooses access paths for both simple (single relation) and complex queries (such as joins), given a user specification of desired data as a boolean expression of predicates. System R is an experimental database management system developed to carry out research on the relational model of data. System R was designed and built by members of the IBM San Jose Research&#039;Laboratory. 1.
74|The Gamma database machine project|This paper describes the design of the Gamma database machine and the techniques employed in its implementation. Gamma is a relational database machine currently operating on an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube with 32 processors and 32 disk drives. Gamma employs three key technical ideas which enable the architecture to be scaled to 100s of processors. First, all relations are horizontally partitioned across multiple disk drives enabling relations to be scanned in parallel. Second, novel parallel algorithms based on hashing are used to implement the complex relational operators such as join and aggregate functions. Third, dataflow scheduling techniques are used to coordinate multioperator queries. By using these techniques it is possible to control the execution of very complex queries with minimal coordination- a necessity for configurations involving a very large number of processors. In addition to describing the design of the Gamma software, a thorough performance evaluation of the iPSC/2 hypercube version of Gamma is also presented. In addition to measuring the effect of relation size and indices on the response time for selection, join, aggregation, and update queries, we also analyze the performance of Gamma relative to the number of processors employed when the sizes of the input relations are kept constant (speedup) and when the sizes of the input relations are increased proportionally to the number of processors (scaleup). The speedup results obtained for both selection and join queries are linear; thus, doubling the number of processors
75|A Performance Evaluation of Four Parallel Join Algorithms in a Shared-Nothing Multiprocessor Environment|The join operator has been a cornerstone of relational database systems since their inception. As such, much time and effort has gone into making joins efficient. With the obvious trend towards multiprocessors, attention has focused on efficiently parallelizing the join operation. In this paper we analyze and compare four parallel join algorithms. Grace and Hybrid hash represent the class of hash-based join methods, Simple hash represents a looping algorithm with hashing, and our last algorithm is the more traditional sort-merge. The Gamma database machine serves as the host for the performance comparison. Gammas shared-nothing architecture with commercially available components is becoming increasingly common, both in research and in industry. 1.
76|Dynamic Query Evaluation Plans|Traditional query optimizers assume accurate knowledge of run-time parameters such as selectivities and resource availability during plan optimization, i.e., at compile-time. In reality, however, this assumption is often not justified. Therefore, the static  plans produced by traditional optimizers may not be optimal for many of their actual run-time invocations. Instead, we propose a novel optimization model that assigns the bulk of the optimization effort to compile-time and delays carefully selected optimization decisions until run-time. Our previous work defined the run-time primitives, dynamic plans  using choose-plan operators, for executing such delayed decisions, but did not solve the problem of constructing dynamic plans at compile-time. The present paper introduces techniques that solve this problem. Experience with a working prototype optimizer demonstrates (i) that the additional optimization and start-up overhead of dynamic plans compared to static plans is dominated by their advantage at run-time, (ii) that dynamic plans are as robust as the brute-force remedy of run-time optimization, i.e., dynamic plans maintain their optimality even if parameters change between compile-time and run-time, and (iii) that the start-up overhead of dynamic plans is signifmantly less than the time required for complete optimization at run-time. In other words, our proposed techniques are superior to both techniques considered to-date, namely compile-time optimization into a single static plan as well as run-time optimization. Finally, we believe that the concepts and technology described can be transferred to commercial query optimizers in order to improve the performance of embedded queries with host variables in the query predicate and to adapt to run-time system loads unpredictable at compile-time. 1.

78|The Design Of Xprs|This paper presents an overview of the techniques we are using to build a DBMS at Berkeley that will simultaneously provide high performance and high availability in transaction processing environments, in applications with complex ad-hoc queries and in applications with large objects such as images or CAD layouts. We plan to achieve these goals using a general purpose DBMS and operating system and a shared memory multiprocessor. The hardware and software tactics which we are using to accomplish these goals are described in this paper and include a novel &#034;fast path&#034; feature, a special purpose concurrency control scheme, a two-dimensional file system, exploitation of parallelism and a novel method to efficiently mirror disks.

This parallelism allows query execution speed to increase almost linearly as processors and discs are added to the system-- speedup. In addition, this parallelism can help jobs restricted to a fIxed &amp;quot;batch window&amp;quot;.

This paper describes the parallelism features of NonStop SQL and an audited benchmark that demonstrates these speedup and scaleup claims.
80|Distributed Computing in Practice: The Condor Experience|Since 1984, the Condor project has enabled ordinary users to do extraordinary computing. Today, the project continues to explore the social and technical problems of cooperative computing on scales ranging from the desktop to the world-wide computational grid. In this chapter, we provide the history and philosophy of the Condor project and describe how it has interacted with other projects and evolved along with the field of distributed computing. We outline the core components of the Condor system and describe how the technology of computing must correspond to social structures. Throughout, we reflect on the lessons of experience and chart the course traveled by research ideas as they grow into production systems.
81|Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System|The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.  
82|The Byzantine Generals Problem|Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one of more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.
83|Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems|This paper presents an algorithm by which a process in a distributed system determines a global state of the system during a computation. Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are computation has terminated,  the system is deadlocked and all tokens in a token ring have disappeared. The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection can also be used for checkpointing. 
84|The Protection of Information in Computer Systems|This tutorial paper explores the mechanics of protecting computer-stored information from unauthorized use or modification. It concentrates on those architectural structures--whether hardware or software--that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading. Glossary The following glossary provides, for reference, brief definitions for several terms as used in this paper in the context of protecting information in computers. Access The ability to make use of information stored in a computer system. Used frequently as a verb, to the horror of grammarians. Access control list A list of principals that are authorized to have access to some object. Authenticate To verify the identity of a person (or other agent external to the protection system) making a request.
85|Kerberos: An Authentication Service for Open Network Systems|In an open network computing environment, a workstation cannot be trusted to identify its users correctly to network services.  Kerberos provides an alternative approach whereby a trusted third-party authentication service is used to verify users identities. This paper gives an overview of the Kerberos authentication model as implemented for MITs Project Athena. It describes the protocols used by clients, servers, and Kerberos to achieve authentication. It also describes the management and replication of the database required.   The views of Kerberos as seen by the user, programmer, and administrator are described.  Finally, the role of Kerberos in the larger Athena picture is given, along with a list of applications that presently use Kerberos for user authentication.  We describe the addition of Kerberos authentication to the Sun Network File System as a case study for integrating Kerberos with an existing application.
86|A Security Architecture for Computational Grids|State-of-the-art and emerging scientific applications require fast access to large quantities of data and commensurately fast computational resources. Both resources and data are often distributed in a wide-area network with components administered locally and independently. Computations may involve hundreds of processes that must be able to acquire resources dynamically and communicate e#ciently. This paper analyzes the unique security requirements of large-scale distributed (grid) computing and develops a security policy and a corresponding security architecture. An implementation of the architecture within the Globus metacomputing toolkit is discussed.  
87|A Resource Management Architecture for Metacomputing Systems|Metacomputing systems are intended to support remote and/or  concurrent use of geographically distributed computational resources.  Resource management in such systems is complicated by five concerns  that do not typically arise in other situations: site autonomy and heterogeneous  substrates at the resources, and application requirements for policy  extensibility, co-allocation, and online control. We describe a resource  management architecture that addresses these concerns. This architecture  distributes the resource management problem among distinct local  manager, resource broker, and resource co-allocator components and defines  an extensible resource specification language to exchange information  about requirements. We describe how these techniques have been  implemented in the context of the Globus metacomputing toolkit and  used to implement a variety of different resource management strategies.  We report on our experiences applying our techniques in a large testbed,  GUSTO, incorporating 15 sites, 330 computers, and 3600 processors.  
88|Extensibility, safety and performance in the SPIN operating system|This paper describes the motivation, architecture and performance of SPIN, an extensible operating system. SPIN provides an extension infrastructure, together with a core set of extensible services, that allow applications to safely change the operating system&#039;s interface and implementation. Extensions allow an application to specialize the underlying operating system in order to achieve a particular level of performance and functionality. SPIN uses language and link-time mechanisms to inexpensively export ne-grained interfaces to operating system services. Extensions are written in a type safe language, and are dynamically linked into the operating system kernel. This approach o ers extensions rapid access to system services, while protecting the operating system code executing within the kernel address space. SPIN and its extensions are written in Modula-3 and run on DEC Alpha workstations. 1
89|Matchmaking: Distributed Resource Management for High Throughput Computing|Conventional resource management systems use a system model to describe resources and a centralized scheduler to control their allocation. We argue that this paradigm does not adapt well to distributed systems, particularly those built to support high-throughput computing. Obstacles include heterogeneity of resources, which make uniform allocation algorithms difficult to formulate, and distributed ownership, leading to widely varying allocation policies. Faced with these problems, we developed and implemented the classified advertisement (classad) matchmaking framework, a flexible and general approach to resource management in distributed environment with decentralized ownership of resources. Novel aspects of the framework include a semi-structured data model that combines schema, data, and query in a simple but powerful specification language, and a clean separation of the matching and claiming phases of resource allocation. The representation and protocols result in a robust, scalabl...
90|BEOWULF: A Parallel Workstation For Scientific Computation|Network-of-Workstations technology is applied to the challenge of implementing very high performance workstations for Earth and space science applications. The Beowulf parallel workstation employs 16 PCbased processing modules integrated with multiple Ethernet networks. Large disk capacity and high disk to memory bandwidth is achieved through the use of a hard disk and controller for each processing module supporting up to 16 way concurrent accesses. The paper presents results from a series of experiments that measure the scaling characteristics of Beowulf in terms of communication bandwidth, file transfer rates, and processing performance. The evaluation includes a computational fluid dynamics code and an N-body gravitational simulation program. It is shown that the Beowulf architecture provides a new operating point in performance to cost for high performance workstations, especially for file transfers under favorable conditions.  1 INTRODUCTION  Networks Of Workstations, or NOW [?] ...
91|Dealing with disaster: Surviving misbehaved kernel extensions|Todays extensible operating systems allow applications to modify kernel behavior by providing mechanisms for application code to run in the kernel address space. The advantage of this approach is that it provides improved application flexibility and performance; the disadvantage is that buggy or malicious code can jeopardize the integrity of the kernel. It has been demonstrated that it is feasible to use safe languages, software fault isolation, or virtual memory protection to safeguard the main kernel. However, such protection mechanisms do not address the full range of problems, such as resource hoarding, that can arise when application code is introduced into the kernel. In this paper, we present an analysis of extension mechanisms in the VINO kernel. VINO uses software fault isolation as its safety mechanism and a lightweight transaction system to cope with resource-hoarding. We explain how these two mechanisms are sufficient to protect against a large class of errant or malicious extensions, and we quantify the overhead that this protection introduces. We find that while the overhead of these techniques is high relative to the cost of the extensions themselves, it is low relative to the benefits that extensibility brings.
92|The locus distributed operating system|LOCUS Is a distributed operating system which supports transparent access to data through a network wide fllesystem, permits automatic replication of storaget supports transparent distributed process execution, supplies a number of high reliability functions such as nested transactions, and is upward compatible with Unix. Partitioned operation of subnetl and their dynamic merge is also supported. The system has been operational for about two years at UCLA and extensive experience In its use has been obtained. The complete system architecture is outlined in this paper, and that experience is summarized. 1
93|Core algorithms of the Maui scheduler|Abstract. The Maui scheduler has received wide acceptance in the HPC community as a highly configurable and effective batch scheduler. It is currently in use on hundreds of SP, O2K, and Linux cluster systems throughout the world including a high percentage of the largest and most cutting edge research sites. While the algorithms used within Maui have proven themselves effective, nothing has been published to date documenting these algorithms nor the configurable aspects they support. This paper focuses on three areas of Maui scheduling, specifically, backfill, job prioritization, and fairshare. It briefly discusses the goals of each component, the issues and corresponding design decisions, and the algorithms enabling the Maui policies. It also covers the configurable aspects of each algorithm and the impact of various parameter selections. 1

95|Stork: Making Data Placement a First Class Citizen in the Grid|Todays scientific applications have huge data requirements which continue to increase drastically every year. These data are generally accessed by many users from all across the the globe. This implies a major necessity to move huge amounts of data around wide area networks to complete the computation cycle, which brings with it the problem of efficient and reliable data placement. The current approach to solve this problem of data placement is either doing it manually, or employing simple scripts which do not have any automation or fault tolerance capabilities. Our goal is to make data placement activities first class citizens in the Grid just like the computational jobs. They will be queued, scheduled, monitored, managed, and even check-pointed. More importantly, it will be made sure that they complete successfully and without any human interaction. We also believe that data placement jobs should be treated differently from computational jobs, since they may have different semantics and different characteristics. For this purpose, we have developed Stork, a scheduler for data placement activities in the Grid.
96|Condor Technical Summary|Condor is a software package for executing long running &#034;batch&#034; type jobs on workstations which would otherwise be idle. Major features of Condor are automatic location and allocation of idle machines, and checkpointing and migration of processes. All of these features are achieved without any modifications to the UNIX kernel whatsoever. Also, users of Condor do not need to change their source programs to run with Condor, although such programs must be specially linked. The features of Condor for both users and workstation owners along with the limitations on the kinds of jobs which may be executed by Condor are described. The mechanisms behind our implementations of checkpointing and process migration are discussed in detail. Finally, the software which detects idle machines and allocates those machines to Condor users is described along with the techniques used to configure that software to meet the demands of a particular computing site or workstation owner.  1. Introduction to the ...
97|Solving Large Quadratic Assignment Problems on Computational Grids|The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is among the hardest combinatorial optimization problems. Some instances of size n = 30 have remained unsolved for decades. The solution of these problems requires both improvements in mathematical programming algorithms and the utilization of powerful computational platforms. In this article we describe a novel approach to solve QAPs using a state-of-the-art branch-and-bound algorithm running on a federation of geographically distributed resources known as a computational grid. Solution of QAPs of unprecedented complexity, including the nug30, kra30b, and tho30 instances, is reported.
98|Resource Management through Multilateral Matchmaking|Federated distributed systems present new challenges to resource management, which cannot be met by conventional systems that employ relatively static resource models and centralized allocators. We previously argued that Matchmaking provides an elegant and robust resource management solution for these highly dynamic environments [5]. Although powerful and flexible, multiparty policies (e.g., co-allocation) cannot be accomodated by Matchmaking. In this paper we present Gang-Matching, a multilateral matchmaking formalism to address this deficiency.
99|Interfacing Condor and PVM to harness the cycles of workstation clusters|A continuing challenge to the scientific research and engineering communities is how to fully utilize computational hardware. In particular, the proliferation of clusters of high performance workstations has become an increasingly attractive source of compute power. Developments to take advantage of this environment have previously focused primarily on managing the resources, or on providing interfaces so that a number of machines can be used in parallel to solve large problems. Both approaches are desirable, and indeed should be complementary. Unfortunately, the resource management and parallel processing systems are usually developed by independent groups, and they usually do not interact well together. To bridge this gap, we have developed a framework for interfacing these two sorts of systems. Using this framework, we have interfaced PVM, a popular system for parallel programming with Condor, a powerful resource management system. This combined system is operational, and we have ma...
100|Parrot: Transparent User-Level Middleware for Data Intensive Computing|Distributed computing continues to be an alphabet-soup of services and protocols for managing computation and storage. To live in this environment, applications require middleware that can transparently adapt standard interfaces to new distributed systems; such software is known as an interposition agent. In this paper, we present several lessons learned about interposition agents via a progressive study of design possibilities. Although performance is an important concern, we pay special attention to less tangible issues such as portability, reliability, and compatibility. We begin with a comparison of seven methods of interposition, focusing on one method, the debugger trap, that requires special techniques to achieve acceptable performance on popular operating systems. Using this method, we implement a complete interposition agent, Parrot, that splices existing remote I/O systems into the namespace of standard applications. The primary design problem of Parrot is the mapping of fixed application semantics into the semantics of the available I/O systems. We offer a detailed discussion of how errors and other unexpected conditions must be carefully managed in order to keep this mapping intact. We conclude with a evaluation of the performance of the I/O protocols employed by Parrot, and use an Andrew-like benchmark to demonstrate that semantic differences have consequences in performance. 1. 
101|Protocols and services for distributed data-intensive science|Abstract. We describe work being performed in the Globus project to develop enabling protocols and services for distributed data-intensive science. These services include: * High-performance, secure data transfer protocols based on FTP, plus a range of libraries and tools that use these protocols * Replica catalog services supporting the creation and location of file replicas in distributed systems These components leverage the substantial body of &#034;Grid &#034; services and protocols developed within the Globus project and by its collaborators, and are being used in a number of data-intensive application projects.
102|Matchmaking Frameworks for Distributed Resource Management|Federated distributed systems present new challenges to resource management. Conventional resource managers are based on a relatively static resource model and a centralized allocator that assigns resources to customers. Distributed envi-ronments, particularly those built to support high-throughput computing (HTC), are often characterized by distributed management and distributed ownership. Distributed management introduces resource heterogeneity: Not only the set of available resources, but even the set of resource types is constantly changing. Distributed ownership introduces policy heterogeneity: Each resource may have its own idiosyncratic allocation policy. We propose a resource management framework based on a matchmaking paradigm to address these shortcomings. Matchmaking services enable discov-ery and exchange of goods and services in marketplaces. Agents that provide or require services advertise their presence by publishing constraints and pref-erences on the entities they would like to be matched with, as well as their own
103|Cheap cycles from the desktop to the dedicated cluster: combining opportunistic and dedicated scheduling with Condor|Clusters of commodity PC hardware running Linux are becoming widely used as computational resources. Most software for controlling clusters relies on dedicated scheduling algorithms. These algorithms assume the constant availability of resources to compute fixed schedules. Unfortunately, due to hardware and software failures, dedicated resources are not always available over the long-term. Moreover, these dedicated scheduling solutions are only applicable to certain classes of jobs, and they can only manage clusters or large SMP machines. The Condor High Throughput Computing System overcomes these limitations by combining aspects of dedicated and opportunistic scheduling into a single system. Both parallel and serial jobs are managed at the same time, allowing a simpler interface for the user and better resource utilization. This paper describes the Condor system, defines opportunistic scheduling, explains how Condor supports MPI jobs with a combination of dedicated and opportunistic scheduling, and shows the advantages gained by such an approach. An exploration of future work in these areas concludes the paper. By using both desktop workstations and dedicated clusters, Condor harnesses all available computational power to enable the best possible science at a low cost.  1 
104|Providing Resource Management Services to Parallel Applications|Because resource management (RM) services are vital to the performance of parallel applications, it is essential that parallel programming environments (PPEs) and RM systems work together. We believe that no single RM system is always the best choice for every application and every computing environment. Therefore, the interface between the PPE and the resource manager must be flexible enough to allow for customization and extension based on the environment. We present a framework for interfacing general PPEs and RM systems. This framework is based on clearly defining the responsibilities of these two components of the system. This framework has been applied to PVM, and two separate instances of RM systems have been implemented. One behaves exactly as PVM always has, while the second uses Condor to extend the set of RM services available to PVM applications. 1 Introduction To fulfill the promises of high performance computing, parallel applications must be provided with effective reso...
105|Gathering at the well: Creating communities for grid I/O|Grid applications have demanding I/O needs. Schedulers must bring jobs and data in close proximity in order to satisfy throughput, scalability, and policy requirements. Most systems accomplish this by making either jobs or data mobile. We propose a system that allows jobs and data to meet by binding execution and storage sites together into I/O communities which then participate in the wide-area system. The relationships between participants in a community may be expressed by the ClassAd framework. Extensions to the framework allow community members to express indirect relations. We demonstrate our implementation of I/O communities by improving the performance of a key high-energy physics simulation on an international distributed system. 1.
106|Bypass: A Tool for Building Split Execution Systems|Split execution is a common model for providing a friendly environment on a foreign machine. In this model, a remotely executing process sends some or all of its system calls back to a home environment for execution. Unfortunately, hand-coding split execution systems for experimentation and research is difficult and error-prone. We have built a tool, Bypass, for quickly producing portable and correct split execution systems for unmodified legacy applications. We demonstrate Bypass by using it to transparently connect a POSIX application to a simple data staging system based on the Globus toolkit. 1. Introduction The split execution model allows a process running on a foreign machine to behave as if it were running on its home machine. Split execution generally involves three software components: an application, an agent, and a shadow. Figure 1 shows these components. Kernel Agent Application Local System Calls Calls System Trapped Kernel Shadow Local System Calls Other...
107|Utilizing Widely Distributed Computational Resources Efficiently with Execution Domains|Wide-area computational grids have the potential to provide large amounts of computing capacity to the scientific community. Realizing this potential requires intelligent data management, enabling applications to harness remote computing resources with minimal remote data access overhead. We define execution domains, a framework which defines an affinity between CPU and data resources in the grid, so applications are scheduled to run on CPUs which have the needed access to datasets and storage devices. The framework also includes domain managers, agents which dynamically adjust the execution domain configuration to support the efficient execution of grid applications. In this paper, we present the execution domain framework and show how we apply it in the Condor resource management system.
108|Error Scope on a Computational Grid: Theory and Practice|Error propagation is a central problem in grid computing. We re-learned this while adding a Java feature to the Condor computational grid. Our initial experience with the system was negative, due to the large number of new ways in which the system could fail. To reason about this problem, we developed a theory of error propagation. Central to our theory is the concept of an error&#039;s scope, defined as the portion of a system that it invalidates. With this theory in hand, we recognized that the expanded system did not properly consider the scope of errors it discovered. We modified the system according to our theory, and succeeded in making it a more robust platform for distributed computing.
109|The DBC: Processing Scientific Data Over the Internet|We present the Distributed Batch Controller (DBC), a system built to support batch processing of large scientific datasets. The DBC implements a federation of autonomous workstation pools, which may be widely-distributed. Individual batch jobs are executed using idle workstations in these pools. Input data are staged to the pool before processing begins. We describe the architecture and implementation of the DBC, and present the results of experiments in which it is used to perform image compression. 1 Introduction  In this paper we present the DBC (Distributed Batch Controller), a system that processes data using widely-distributed computational resources. The DBC was built as a tool for enriching scientific data stored in two mass storage systems at NASA&#039;s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Enriching data means processing it to make it more useful. For example, satellite images may be classified according to some domain-specific criteria. These classifications can then be stored as ...
110|Efficient similarity search in sequence databases|We propose an indexing method for time sequences for processing similarity queries. We use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval&#039;s theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coe cients, we use R-trees to index the sequences and e ciently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients (1-3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length of sequences. 
111|A Survey of Image Registration Techniques|Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to  match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times,  from different sensors or from different viewpoints. Over the years, a  broad range of techniques have been developed for the various types of  data and problems. These techniques have been independently studied  for several different applications resulting in a large body of research.  This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship  between the distortions in the image and the type of registration techniques  which are most suitable. Two major types of distortions are  distinguished. The first type are those which are the source of misregistration,  i.e., they are the cause of the misalignment between the two  images. Distortions which are the source of misregistration determine  the transformation class which will optimally align the two images.  The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that  should be taken....
112|Voronoi diagrams -- a survey of a fundamental geometric data structure|This paper presents a survey of the Voronoi diagram, one of the most fundamental data structures in computational geometry. It demonstrates the importance and usefulness of the Voronoi diagram in a wide variety of fields inside and outside computer science and surveys the history of its development. The paper puts particular emphasis on the unified exposition of its mathematical and algorithmic properties. Finally, the paper provides the first comprehensive bibliography on Voronoi diagrams and related structures.
113|Database Mining: A Performance Perspective|We present our perspective of database mining as the confluence of machine learning techniques and the performance emphasis of database technology. We describe three classes of database mining problems involving classification, associations, and sequences, and argue that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive data. We describe a model and some basic operations for the process of rule discovery. We show how the database mining problems we consider map to this model and how they can be solved by using the basic operations we propose. We give an example of an algorithm for classification obtained by combining the basic rule discovery operations. This algorithm not only is efficient in discovering classification rules but also has accuracy comparable to ID3, one of the current best classifiers.  Index Terms. database mining, knowledge discovery, classification, associations, sequences, decision trees   Current address: Computer Science De...
114|Temporal databases|A temporal database (see Temporal Database) contains time-varying data. Time is an important aspect of all real-world phenomena. Events occur at specific points in time; objects and the relationships among objects exist over time. The ability to model this temporal dimension of the real world is essential to many computer applications, such as accounting, banking, econometrics, geographical information systems, inventory control, law, medical records, multi-media, process control, reservation systems, and scientific data analysis. Conventional databases represent the state of an enterprise at a single moment of time. Although the contents of the database continue to change as new information is added, these changes are viewed as modifications to the state, with the old, out-of-date data being deleted from the database. The current contents of the database may be viewed as a snapshot of the enterprise. When a conventional database is used, the attributes involving time are manipulated solely by the application programs, with little help
115|The hB-tree: A multiattribute indexing method with good guaranteed performance|A new multiattribute index structure called the hB-tree is introduced. It is derived from the K-D-B-tree of Robinson [15] but has additional desirable properties. The hB-tree internode search and growth processes are precisely analogous to the corresponding processes in B-trees [l]. The intranode processes are unique. A k-d tree is used as the structure within nodes for very efficient searching. Node splitting requires that this k-d tree be split. This produces nodes which no longer represent brick-like regions in k-space, but that can be characterized as holey bricks, bricks in which subregions have been extracted. We present results that guarantee hB-tree users decent storage utilization, reasonable size index terms, and good search and insert performance. These results guarantee that the hB-tree copes well with arbitrary distributions of keys.
116|Vague: a user interface to relational databases that permits vague queries|A specific query establishes a rigid qualification and is concerned only with data that match it precisely. A vague query establishes a target qualification and is concerned also with data that are close to this target. Most conventional database systems cannot handle vague queries directly, forcing their users to retry specific queries repeatedly with minor modifications until they match data that are satisfactory. This article describes a system called VAGUE that can handle vague queries directly. The principal concept behind VAGUE is its extension to the relational data model with data metrics, which are definitions of distances between values of the same domain. A problem with implementing data distances is that different users may have different interpretations for the notion of distance. VAGUE incorporates several features that enable it to adapt itself to the individual views and priorities of its users.
117|New Techniques for Best-Match Retrieval|A scheme to answer best-match queries from a file containing a collection of objects is described. A best-match query is to find the objects in the file that are closest (according to some (dis)similarity measure) to a given target. Previous work [5, 331 suggests that one can reduce the number of comparisons required to achieve the desired results using the triangle inequality, starting with a data structure for the file that reflects some precomputed intrafile distances. We generalize the technique to allow the optimum use of any given set of precomputed intrafile distances. Some empirical results are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme, and its performance relative to previous algorithms.
118|The process group approach to reliable distributed computing|The difficulty of developing reliable distributed softwme is an impediment to applying distributed computing technology in many settings. Expeti _ with the Isis system suggests that a structured approach based on virtually synchronous _ groups yields systems that are substantially easier to develop, exploit sophisticated forms of cooperative computation, and achieve high reliability. This paper reviews six years of resemr,.hon Isis, describing the model, its impl_nentation challenges, and the types of applicatiom to which Isis has been appfied. 1 In oducfion One might expect the reliability of a distributed system to follow directly from the reliability of its con-stituents, but this is not always the case. The mechanisms used to structure a distributed system and to implement cooperation between components play a vital role in determining how reliable the system will be. Many contemporary distributed operating systems have placed emphasis on communication performance, overlooking the need for tools to integrate components into a reliable whole. The communication primitives supported give generally reliable behavior, but exhibit problematic semantics when transient failures or system configuration changes occur. The resulting building blocks are, therefore, unsuitable for facilitating the construction of systems where reliability is impo/tant. This paper reviews six years of research on Isis, a syg_,,m that provides tools _ support the construction of reliable distributed software. The thesis underlying l._lS is that development of reliable distributed software can be simplified using process groups and group programming too/_. This paper motivates the approach taken, surveys the system, and discusses our experience with real applications.
120|Transis: A Communication Sub-System for High Availability|This paper describes Transis, a communication sub-system for high availability. Transis is a transport layer package that supports a variety of reliable multicast message passing services between processors. It provides highly tuned multicast and control services for scalable systems with arbitrary topology. The communication domain comprises of a set of processors that can initiate multicast messages to a chosen subset. Transis delivers them reliably and maintains the  membership of connected processors automatically, in the presence of arbitrary communication delays, of message losses and of processor failures and joins. The contribution of this paper is in providing an aggregate definition of communication and control services over broadcast domains. The main benefit is the efficient implementation of these services using the broadcast capability. In addition, the membership algorithm has a novel approach in handling partitions and remerging; in allowing the regular flow of messages...

The responsible editor was Susan L. Graham. The authors and editor kindly agreed to transfer the paper to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems
122|Memory access buffering in multiprocessors|In highly-pipelined machines, instructions and data are prefetched and buffered in both the processor and the cache. This is done to reduce the average memory access la-tency and to take advantage of memory interleaving. Lock-up free caches are designed to avoid processor blocking on a cache miss. Write buffers are often included in a pipelined machine to avoid processor waiting on writes. In a shared memory multiprocessor, there are more advantages in buffering memory requests, since each memory access has to traverse the memory- processor interconnection and has to compete with memory requests issued by different processors. Buffering, however, can cause logical problems in multipro-cessors. These problems are aggravated if each processor has a private memory in which shared writable data may be present, such as in a cache-based system or in a system with a distributed global memory. In this paper, we analyze the benefits and problems associated with the buffering of memory requests in shared memory multiprocessors. We show that the logical problem of buffering is directly related to the problem of synchronization. A simple model is presented to evaluate the performance improvement result-ing from buffering. 1.
123|Using Process Groups to Implement Failure Detection in Asynchronous Environments|Agreement on the membership of a group of processes in a distributed system is a basic problem that arises in a wide range of applications. Such groups occur when a set of processes co-operate to perform some task, share memory, monitor one another, subdivide a computation, and so forth. In this paper we discuss the Group Membership Problem as it relates to failure detection in asynchronous, distributed systems. We present a rigorous, formal specification for group membership under this interpretation. We then present a solution for this problem that improves upon previous work.
124|An Efficient Reliable Broadcast Protocol|Many distributed and parallel applications can make good use of  broadcast communication. In this paper we present a (software) protocol  that simulates reliable broadcast, even on an unreliable network. Using  this protocol, application programs need not worry about lost messages.  Recovery of communication failures is handled automatically and transparently  by the protocol. In normal operation, our protocol is more  efficient than previously published reliable broadcast protocols. An initial  implementation of the protocol on 10 MC68020 CPUs connected by a 10  Mbit/sec Ethernet performs a reliable broadcast in 1.5 msec.   
125|The Distributed V Kernel and its Performance for Diskless Workstations|The distributed V kernel is a message-oriented kernel that provides uniform local and network interprocess communication. It is primarily being used in an environment of diskless workstations connected by a high-speed local network to a set of file servers. We describe a performance evaluation of the kernel, with particular emphasis on the cost of network file access. Our results show that over a local network: 1. Diskless workstations can access remote files with minimal performance penalty. 2. The V message facility can be used to access remote files at comparable cost to any well-tuned specialized file access protocol. We conclude that it is feasible to build a distributed system with all network communication using the V message facility even when most of the network nodes have no secondary storage. 1.
126|Highly-available distributed services and fault-tolerant distributed garbage collection|This paper describes two techniques that are only loosely related. The first is a method for constructing a highly available service for use in a distributed system. The service presents its clients with a consistent view of its state, but the view may contain old information. Clients can indicate how recent the information must be. The method can be used in any application in which the property of interest is stable: once the property becomes true, it remains true forever. The paper also describes a fault-tolerant garbage collection method for a distributed heap. The method is practical and efficient. Each computer that contains part of the heap does local garbage collection independently, using whatever algorithm it chooses, and without needing to communicate with the other computers that contain parts of the heap. The highly available central service is used to store information about inter.computer references. 1.

128|Nested Transactions: An Approach to Reliable Distributed Computing|Distributed computing systems are being built and used more and more frequently. This distributod computing revolution makes the reliability of distributed systems an important concern. It is fairly well-understood how to connect hardware so that most components can continue to work when others are broken, and thus increase the reliability of a system as a whole. This report addressos the issue of providing software for reliable distributed systems. In particular, we examine how to program a system so that the software continues to work in tho face of a variety of failures of parts of the system. The design presented
129|Weighted Voting for Replicated Data|In a new algorithm for maintaining replicated data, every copy of a replicated file is assigned some number of votes. Every transaction collects a read quorum of r votes to read a file, and a write quorum of w votes to write a file, such that r+w is greater than the total number number of votes assigned to the file. This ensures that there is a non-null intersection between every read quorum and every write quorum. Version numbers make it possible to determine which copies are current. The reliability and performance characteristics of a replicated file can be controlled by appropriately choosing r, w, and the file&#039;s voting configuration. The algorithm guarantees serial consistency, admits temporary copies in a natural way by the introduction of copies of an application system called Violet.
130|A majority consensus approach to concurrency control for multiple copy databases|A majority consensus  algorithm which represents a new solution to the update synchronization problem for multiple copy databases is presented. The algorithm embodies distributed control and can function effectively in the presence of communication and database site outages. The correctness of the algorithm is demonstrated and the cost of using it is analyzed. Several examples that illustrate aspects of the algorithm operation are included in the Appendix.
131|State Restoration in Systems of Communicating Processes|Abstract-In systems of asynchronous processes using messagelists with SEND-RECEIVE primitives for interprocess communication recovery primitives are defined to perform state restoration: MARK saves a particular point in the execution of the program; RESTORE resets the system state to an earlier point (saved by MARK); and PURGE discards redundant information when it is no longer needed for possible state restoration. Errors may be propagated through the system, requiring state restoration also to be propagated. Different types of propagation of state restoration are identified. Data structures and procedures are sketched that Implement the recovery primitives. In ill-structured systems the domino effect can occur, resulting in a catastrophic avalanche of backup activity and causing many messagelist operations to be undone. Sufficient conditions are developed for a system to be domino-free. Explicit bounds on the amount of unnecessary restoration are determined for certain classes of systems, including systems where the sequence of recovery and messagelist primitives is described by the regular expression (MARK; RECEIVE*; SEND*)*. Index Terms-Backup, domino effect, error recovery, parallel backtralcking, process communication, recovery blocks, state restoration. I.

134|On Linguistic Support for Distributed Programs|Technological advances have made it possible to construct systems from collections of computers connected by a network. At present, however, there is little support for the construction and execution of software to run on such a system. Our research concerns the development of an integrated language/system whose goal is to provide the needed support. This paper discusses a number of issues that must be addressed in such a language. The major focus of our work and this paper is support for the construction of robust software that survives node, network, and media failures.
135|Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data|Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.  
136|MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters|MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the programs execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Googles clusters every day.  
137|Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors|this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash- coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency
138|The Google File System |We have designed and implemented the Google File Sys-tem, a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients. While sharing many of the same goals as previous dis-tributed file systems, our design has been driven by obser-vations of our application workloads and technological envi-ronment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and explore rad-ically different design points. The file system has successfully met our storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google as the storage platform for the generation and processing of data used by our ser-vice as well as research and development efforts that require large data sets. The largest cluster to date provides hun-dreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In this paper, we present file system interface extensions designed to support distributed applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real world use.

140|Resource Containers: A New Facility for Resource Management in Server Systems|General-purpose operating systems provide inadequate support for resource management in large-scale servers. Applications lack sufficient control over scheduling and management of machine resources, which makes it difficult to enforce priority policies, and to provide robust and controlled service. There is a fundamental mismatch between the original design assumptions underlying the resource management mechanisms of current general-purpose operating systems, and the behavior of modern server applications. In particular, the operating systems notions of protection domain and resource principal coincide in the process abstraction. This coincidence prevents a process that manages large numbers of network connections, for example, from properly allocating system resources among those connections. We propose and evaluate a new operating system abstraction called a resource container, which separates the notion of a protection domain from that of a resource principal. Resource containers enable fine-grained resource management in server systems and allow the development of robust servers, with simple and firm control over priority policies. 1
141|Operating System Support for Planetary-Scale Network Services|PlanetLab is a geographically distributed overlay network designed to support the deployment and evaluation of planetary-scale network services. Two high-level goals shape its design. First, to enable a large research community to share the infrastructure, PlanetLab provides distributed virtualization, whereby each service runs in an isolated slice of PlanetLabs global resources. Second, to support competition among multiple network services, PlanetLab decouples the operating system running on each node from the networkwide services that define PlanetLab, a principle referred to as unbundled management. This paper describes how Planet-Lab realizes the goals of distributed virtualization and unbundled management, with a focus on the OS running on each node. 1
142|Paxos made live: an engineering perspective|We describe our experience building a fault-tolerant data-base using the Paxos consensus algorithm. Despite the existing literature in the field, building such a database proved to be non-trivial. We describe selected algorithmic and engineering problems encountered, and the solutions we found for them. Our measurements indicate that we have built a competitive system. 1
143|Integrating compression and execution in column-oriented database systems|Column-oriented database system architectures invite a reevaluation of how and when data in databases is compressed. Storing data in a column-oriented fashion greatly increases the similarity of adjacent records on disk and thus opportunities for compression. The ability to compress many adjacent tuples at once lowers the per-tuple cost of compression, both in terms of CPU and space overheads. In this paper, we discuss how we extended C-Store (a column-oriented DBMS) with a compression sub-system. We show how compression schemes not traditionally used in roworiented DBMSs can be applied to column-oriented systems. We then evaluate a set of compression schemes and show that the best scheme depends not only on the properties of the data but also on the nature of the query workload.
144|Weaving Relations for Cache Performance|Relational database systems have traditionally optimzed for I/O performance and organized records sequentially on disk pages using the N-ary Storage Model (NSM) (a.k.a., slotted pages). Recent research, however, indicates that cache utilization and performance is becoming increasingly important on modern platforms. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in-page data placement is the key to high cache performance and that NSM exhibits low cache utilization on modern platforms. Next, we propose a new data organization model called PAX (Partition Attributes Across), that significantly improves cache performance by grouping together all values of each attribute within each page. Because PAX only affects layout inside the pages, it incurs no storage penalty and does not affect I/O behavior. According to our experimental results, when compared to NSM (a) PAX exhibits superior cache and memory bandwidth utilization, saving at least 75% of NSM&#039;s stall time due to data cache accesses, (b) range selection queries and updates on memoryresident relations execute 17-25% faster, and (c) TPC-H queries involving I/O execute 11-48% faster.
145|DB2 Parallel Edition|The rate of increase in database size and response time requirements has outpaced  advancements in processor and mass storage technology. One way to satisfy the increasing  demand for processing power and I/O bandwidth in database applications is to have a  number of processors, loosely or tightly coupled, serving database requests concurrently.  Technologies developed during the last decade have made commercial parallel database  systems a reality and these systems have made an inroad into the stronghold of traditionally  mainframe based large database applications. This paper describes the parallel database  project initiated at IBM Research at Hawthorne and the DB2/AIX-PE product based on  it.  1 Introduction  Large scale parallel processing technology has made giant strides in the past decade and there is no doubt that it has established a place for itself. However, almost all of the applications harnessing this technology are scientific or engineering applications. The lack of com...
146|A Comparative Analysis of Methodologies for Database Schema Integration| One of the fundamental principles of the database approach is that a database allows a nonredundant, unified representation of all data managed in an organization. This is achieved only when methodologies are available to support integration across organizational and application boundaries. 

Methodologies for database design usually perform the design activity by separately producing several schemas, representing parts of the application, which are subsequently merged. Database schema integration is the activity of integrating the schemas of existing or proposed databases into a global, unified schema. The aim of the paper is to provide first a unifying framework for the problem of schema integration, then a comparative review of the work done thus far in this area. Such a framework, with the associated analysis of the existing approaches, provides a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses of individual methodologies, as well as general guidelines for future improvements and extensions.

149|The Merge/Purge Problem for Large Databases|Many commercial organizations routinely gather large numbers of databases for various marketing and business analysis functions. The task is to correlate information from different databases by identifying distinct individuals that appear in a number of different databases typically in an inconsistent and often incorrect fashion. The problem we study here is the task of merging data from multiple sources in as efficient manner as possible, while maximizing the accuracy of the result. We call this the merge/purge problem. In this paper we detail the sorted neighborhood method that is used by some to solve merge/purge and present experimental results that demonstrates this approach may work well in practice but at great expense. An alternative method based upon clustering is also presented with a comparative evaluation to the sorted neighborhood method. We show a means of improving the accuracy of the results based upon a multi-pass approach that succeeds by computing the Transitive Clos...
150|Unexpectedness as a Measure of Interestingness in Knowledge Discovery|Organizations are taking advantage of &#034;data-mining&#034; techniques to leverage the vast amounts of data captured as they process routine transactions. Data-mining is the process of discovering hidden structure or patterns in data. However several of the pattern discovery methods in datamining systems have the drawbacks that they discover too many obvious or irrelevant patterns and that they do not leverage to a full extent valuable prior domain knowledge that managers have. This research addresses these drawbacks by developing ways to generate interesting patterns by incorporating managers&#039; prior knowledge in the process of searching for patterns in data. Specifically we focus on providing methods that generate unexpected patterns with respect to managerial intuition by eliciting managers&#039; beliefs about the domain and using these beliefs to seed the search for unexpected patterns in data. Our approach should lead to the development of decision support systems that provide managers with mor...

We present a rule refinement strategy, partly implemented in a Prolog program, that operationalizes &#034;interestingness &#034; into performance, simplicity, novelty, and significance.

156| 	 Active Data Mining   |We introduce an active data mining paradigm that combines the recent work in data mining with the rich literature on active database systems. In this paradigm, data is continuously mined at a desired frequency. As rules are discovered, they are added to a rulebase, and if they already exist, the history of the statistical parameters associated with the rules is updated. When the history starts exhibiting certain trends, specified as shape queries in the user-speci ed triggers, the triggers are red and appropriate actions are initiated. To be able to specify shape queries, we describe the constructs for de ning shapes, and discuss how the shape predicates are used in a query construct to retrieve rules whose histories exhibit the desired trends. We describe how this query capability is integrated into a trigger system to realize an active mining system. The system presented here has been validated using two sets of customer data.
157|Fast Spatio-Temporal Data Mining of Large Geophysical Datasets|The important scientific challenge of understanding global climate change is one that clearly requires the application of knowledge discovery and datamining techniques on a massive scale. Advances in parallel supercomputing technology, enabling high-resolution modeling, as well as in sensor technology, allowing data capture on an unprecedented scale, conspire to overwhelm present-day analysis approaches. We present here early experiences with a prototype exploratory data analysis environment, CONQUEST, designed to provide content-based access to such massive scientific datasets. CONQUEST (CONtent-based Querying in Space and Time) employs a combination of workstations and massively parallel processors (MPP&#039;s) to mine geophysical datasets possessing a prominent temporal component. It is designed to enable complex multi-modal interactive querying and knowledge discovery, while simultaneously coping with the extraordinary computational demands posed by the scope of the datasets involved.

New classification techniques developed at IBM Research, including minimal rule generation (R-MINI) and contextual feature analysis, seem robust enough for consistently extracting useful information from noisy domains such as financial markets. We will briefly introduce the rationale for our minimal rule generation technique, and the motivation for the use of contextual information in analyzing features. We will then describe our experience from several experiments with the S&amp;P 500 data, illustrating the general methodology, and the results of correlations and simulated managed investment based on classification rules generated by R-MINI.

159|Graphical Models for Discovering Knowledge|There are many different ways of representing knowledge, and for each of these ways there are many different discovery algorithms. How can we compare different representations? How can we mix, match and merge representations and algorithms on new problems with their own unique requirements? This chapter introduces probabilistic modeling as a philosophy for addressing these questions and presents graphical models for representing probabilistic models. Probabilistic graphical models are a unified qualitative and quantitative framework for representing and reasoning with probabilities and independencies. 4.1 Introduction Perhaps one common element of the discovery systems described in this and previous books on knowledge discovery is that they are all different. Since the class of discovery problems is a challenging one, we cannot write a single program to address all of knowledge discovery.

161|Analyzing the Benefits of Domain Knowledge in Substructure Discovery|Discovering repetitive, interesting, and functional substructures in a structural  database improves the ability to interpret and compress the data. However, scientists  working with a database in their area of expertise often search for a predetermined  type of structure, or for structures exhibiting characteristics specic to the domain.  This paper presents methods for guiding the discovery process with domain-specic  knowledge. In this paper, the Subdue discovery system is used to evaluate the bene-  ts of using domain knowledge. The domain knowledge is incorporated into Subdue  following a single general methodology to guide the discovery process. Results show  using domain-specic knowledge improves the search for substructures which are useful  to the domain, and leads to greater compression of the data.

162|Gapped Blast and PsiBlast: a new generation of protein database search programs|The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.

An implementation of this algorithm is currently used in a program that assembles the UniGene database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.

174|A Fast Quantum Mechanical Algorithm for Database Search|Imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. In order to find someone&#039;s phone number with a probability of , any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic)
will need to look at a minimum of names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.
175|Algorithms for Quantum Computation: Discrete Logarithms and Factoring|A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in com-putation time of at most a polynomial factol: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their compu-tational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. (We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanulysis.)
176|Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer|computer
177|Quantum complexity theory|Abstract. In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutschs model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension. We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that O(log T) bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the ChurchTuring thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class BPP. The class BQP of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies BPP ? BQP ? P ?P. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

We show applications of this lemma to parallel computation and randomized reductions.

186|Principled Disambiguation: Discriminating Adjective Senses with . . .|... In this paper we argue for a linguistically principled approach to disambiguation, in which relevant contextual clues are narrowly defined, in syntactic and semantic terms, and in which only highly reliable clues are exploited. Statistical methods play a definite role in this work, helping to organize and analyze data, but the disambiguation method itself does not employ statistical data or decision criteria. This approach results in improved understanding of the disambiguation problem both in general and on a word-specific basis and leads to broadly applicable and nearly errorless clues to word sense. The approach is illustrated by an experiment discriminating among the senses of adjectives, which have been relatively neglected in work on sense disambiguation. In particular, the paper assesses the potential of nouns for discriminating among the senses of adjectives that modify them. This assessment is based on an empirical study of five of the most frequent ambiguous adjectives in English: hard, light, old, right, and short. About three-quarters of all instances of these adjectives can be disambiguated almost errorlessly by the nouns they modify or by the syntactic constructions in which they occur. Such disambiguation requires only simple rules, which can be automated easily. Furthermore, a small number of semantic attributes supply a compact means of representing the noun clues in a very few rules. Clues other than nouns are required when modified nouns are not useable. The sense of an ambiguous modified noun may be needed to determine the relevant semantic attribute for disambiguation of a target adjective; and other adjectives, verbs, and grammatical constructions all show evidence of high reliability, and sometimes of high applicability, when they stand in specific, ...
187|Near Optimal Signal Recovery From Random Projections: Universal Encoding Strategies?|Suppose we are given a vector f in RN. How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision ? in the Euclidean (l2) metric? Or more exactly, suppose we are interested in a class F of such objects discrete digital signals, images, etc; how many linear measurements do we need to recover objects from this class to within accuracy ?? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse or compressible in the sense that the reordered entries of a signal f ? F decay like a power-law (or if the coefficient sequence of f in a fixed basis decays like a power-law), then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements. typical result is as follows: we rearrange the entries of f (or its coefficients in a fixed basis) in decreasing order of magnitude |f | (1)  = |f | (2)  =... = |f | (N), and define the weak-lp ball as the class F of those elements whose entries obey the power decay law |f | (n)  = C · n -1/p. We take measurements <f, Xk>, k = 1,..., K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian
188|Compressed sensing|We study the notion of Compressed Sensing (CS) as put forward in [14] and related work [20, 3, 4]. The basic idea behind CS is that a signal or image, unknown but supposed to be compressible by a known transform, (eg. wavelet or Fourier), can be subjected to fewer measurements than the nominal number of pixels, and yet be accurately reconstructed. The samples are nonadaptive and measure random  linear combinations of the transform coefficients. Approximate reconstruction is obtained by solving for the transform coefficients consistent with measured data and having the smallest possible `1 norm. We perform a series of numerical experiments which validate in general terms the basic idea proposed in [14, 3, 5], in the favorable case where the transform coefficients are sparse in the strong sense that the vast majority are zero. We then consider a range of less-favorable cases, in which the object has all coefficients nonzero, but the coefficients obey an `p bound, for some p ? (0, 1]. These experiments show that the basic inequalities behind the CS method seem to involve reasonable constants. We next consider synthetic examples modelling problems in spectroscopy and image pro-
189|ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION BY BASIS PURSUIT|The Time-Frequency and Time-Scale communities have recently developed a large number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries -- stationary wavelets, wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the Method of Frames (MOF), Matching Pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the Best Orthogonal Basis (BOB). Basis Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an &#034;optimal&#034; superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l 1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP and BOB, including better sparsity, and super-resolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract harmonic analysis, total variation de-noising, and multi-scale edge denoising. Basis Pursuit in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient solver.
190|Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction From Highly Incomplete Frequency Information|This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal and a randomly chosen set of frequencies. Is it possible to reconstruct from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that is a superposition of spikes @ Aa @ A @ A obeying @?? ? A I for some constant H. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least I @ A, can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the I minimization problem I aH @ A s.t.  @ Aa   @ A for all
191|Nonlinear total variation based noise removal algorithms|A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lagrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t--- ~ 0o the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set. 
192|Decoding by Linear Programming|This paper considers the classical error correcting problem which is frequently discussed in coding theory. We wish to recover an input vector f ? Rn from corrupted measurements y = Af + e. Here, A is an m by n (coding) matrix and e is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover f exactly from the data y? We prove that under suitable conditions on the coding matrix A, the input f is the unique solution to the l1-minimization problem (?x?l1:= i |xi|) min g?R n ?y - Ag?l1 provided that the support of the vector of errors is not too large, ?e?l0: = |{i: ei ?= 0} |  = ? · m for some ?&gt; 0. In short, f can be recovered exactly by solving a simple convex optimization problem (which one can recast as a linear program). In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; f is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted. This work is related to the problem of finding sparse solutions to vastly underdetermined systems of linear equations. There are also significant connections with the problem of recovering signals from highly incomplete measurements. In fact, the results introduced in this paper improve on our earlier work [5]. Finally, underlying the success of l1 is a crucial property we call the uniform uncertainty principle that we shall describe in detail.
193|The space complexity of approximating the frequency moments|The frequency moments of a sequence containing mi elements of type i, for 1 = i = n, are the numbers Fk = ?n i=1 mki. We consider the space complexity of randomized algorithms that approximate the numbers Fk, when the elements of the sequence are given one by one and cannot be stored. Surprisingly, it turns out that the numbers F0, F1 and F2 can be approximated in logarithmic space, whereas the approximation of Fk for k = 6 requires n?(1) space. Applications to data bases are mentioned as well. 
194| Optimally sparse representation in general (non-orthogonal) dictionaries via l¹ minimization  (2002) |Given a dictionary D = {dk} of vectors dk, we seek to represent a signal S as a linear combination S = ? k ?(k)dk, with scalar coefficients ?(k). In particular, we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general, this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases, and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the l¹ norm of the coefficients ?. In this paper, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We introduce the Spark, ameasure of linear dependence in such a system; it is the size of the smallest linearly dependent subset (dk). We show that, when the signal S has a representation using less than Spark(D)/2 nonzeros, this representation is necessarily unique. We
195|Uncertainty principles and ideal atomic decomposition|Suppose a discrete-time signal S(t), 0 t&lt;N, is a superposition of atoms taken from a combined time/frequency dictionary made of spike sequences 1ft = g and sinusoids expf2 iwt=N) = p N. Can one recover, from knowledge of S alone, the precise collection of atoms going to make up S? Because every discrete-time signal can be represented as a superposition of spikes alone, or as a superposition of sinusoids alone, there is no unique way of writing S as a sum of spikes and sinusoids in general. We prove that if S is representable as a highly sparse superposition of atoms from this time/frequency dictionary, then there is only one such highly sparse representation of S, and it can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problem of minimizing the `1 norm of the coe cients among all decompositions. Here \highly sparse &#034; means that Nt + Nw &lt; p N=2 where Nt is the number of time atoms, Nw is the number of frequency atoms, and N is the length of the discrete-time signal.
196|For Most Large Underdetermined Systems of Linear Equations the Minimal l1-norm Solution is also the Sparsest Solution|We consider linear equations y = Fa where y is a given vector in R n, F is a given n by m matrix with n &lt; m = An, and we wish to solve for a ? R m. We suppose that the columns of F are normalized to unit l 2 norm 1 and we place uniform measure on such F. We prove the existence of ? = ?(A) so that for large n, and for all Fs except a negligible fraction, the following property holds: For every y having a representation y = Fa0 by a coefficient vector a0 ? R m with fewer than ? · n nonzeros, the solution a1 of the l 1 minimization problem min ?x?1 subject to Fa = y is unique and equal to a0. In contrast, heuristic attempts to sparsely solve such systems  greedy algorithms and thresholding  perform poorly in this challenging setting. The techniques include the use of random proportional embeddings and almost-spherical sections in Banach space theory, and deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of random Wishart matrices.
197|New tight frames of curvelets and optimal representations of objects with piecewise C² singularities|This paper introduces new tight frames of curvelets to address the problem of finding optimally sparse representations of objects with discontinuities along C2 edges. Conceptually, the curvelet transform is a multiscale pyramid with many directions and positions at each length scale, and needle-shaped elements at fine scales. These elements have many useful geometric multiscale features that set them apart from classical multiscale representations such as wavelets. For instance, curvelets obey a parabolic scaling relation which says that at scale 2-j, each element has an envelope which is aligned along a ridge  of length 2-j/2 and width 2-j. We prove that curvelets provide an essentially optimal representation of typical objects f which are C2 except for discontinuities along C2 curves. Such representations are nearly as sparse as if f were not singular and turn out to be far more sparse than the wavelet decomposition of the object. For instance, the n-term partial reconstruction f C n obtained by selecting the n largest terms in the curvelet series obeys ?f - f C n ? 2 L2 = C · n-2 · (log n) 3, n ? 8. This rate of convergence holds uniformly over a class of functions which are C 2 except for discontinuities along C 2 curves and is essentially optimal. In comparison, the squared error of n-term wavelet approximations only converges as n -1 as n ? 8, which is considerably worst than the optimal behavior.
198|On the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in principal components analysis|Let x ?1 ? denote the square of the largest singular value of an n × p matrix X, all of whose entries are independent standard Gaussian variates. Equivalently, x ?1 ? is the largest principal component variance of the covariance matrix X ' X, or the largest eigenvalue of a p-variate Wishart distribution on n degrees of freedom with identity covariance. Consider the limit of large p and n with n/p = ? = 1. When centered by µ p = ?  v n - 1 + v p ? 2 and scaled by s p = ?  v n - 1 + v p??1 /  v n - 1 + 1 /  v p ? 1/3 ? the distribution of x ?1 ? approaches the TracyWidom lawof order 1, which is defined in terms of the Painlevé II differential equation and can be numerically evaluated and tabulated in software. Simulations showthe approximation to be informative for n and p as small as 5. The limit is derived via a corresponding result for complex Wishart matrices using methods from random matrix theory. The result suggests that some aspects of large p multivariate distribution theory may be easier to apply in practice than their fixed p counterparts.  
199|On sparse representations in arbitrary redundant bases|AbstractThe purpose of this contribution is to generalize some recent results on sparse representations of signals in redundant bases. The question that is considered is the following: given a matrix of dimension ( ) with and a vector = , find a sufficient condition for to have a unique sparsest representation as a linear combination of columns of. Answers to this question are known when is the concatenation of two unitary matrices and either an extensive combinatorial search is performed or a linear program is solved. We consider arbitrary matrices and give a sufficient condition for the unique sparsest solution to be the unique solution to both a linear program or a parametrized quadratic program. The proof is elementary and the possibility of using a quadratic program opens perspectives to the case where = + with a vector of noise or modeling errors.

201|Quantitative Robust Uncertainty Principles and Optimally Sparse Decompositions|In this paper, we develop a robust uncertainty principle for finite signals in C N which states that for nearly all choices T, ? ? {0,..., N - 1} such that |T | + |? |  ? (log N) -1/2 · N, there is no signal f supported on T whose discrete Fourier transform  f is supported on ?. In fact, we can make the above uncertainty principle quantitative in the sense that if f is supported on T, then only a small percentage of the energy (less than half, say) of  f is concentrated on ?. As an application of this robust uncertainty principle (QRUP), we consider the problem of decomposing a signal into a sparse superposition of spikes and complex sinusoids f(s)  = ? a1(t)d(s - t) + ? a2(?)e i2p?s/N /  v N. t?T We show that if a generic signal f has a decomposition (a1, a2) using spike and frequency locations in T and ? respectively, and obeying ??? |T | + |? |  = Const · (log N) -1/2 · N, then (a1, a2) is the unique sparsest possible decomposition (all other decompositions have more non-zero terms). In addition, if |T | + |? |  = Const · (log N) -1 · N, then the sparsest (a1, a2) can be found by solving a convex optimization problem. Underlying our results is a new probabilistic approach which insists on finding the correct uncertainty relation or the optimally sparse solution for nearly all subsets but not necessarily all of them, and allows to considerably sharpen previously known results [9, 10]. In fact, we show that the fraction of sets (T, ?) for which the above properties do not hold can be upper bounded by quantities like N -a for large values of a. The QRUP (and the application to finding sparse representations) can be extended to general pairs of orthogonal bases F1, F2 of C N. For nearly all choices G1, G2 ? {0,..., N - 1} obeying |G1 | + |G2 |  ? µ(F1, F2) -2 · (log N) -m, where m = 6, there is no signal f such that F1f is supported on G1 and F2f is supported on G2 where µ(F1, F2) is the mutual coherence between F1 and F2.

205|Sparse reconstruction by convex relaxation: Fourier and Gaussian measurements|Abstract  This paper proves best known guarantees for exact reconstruction of a sparse signal f from few non-adaptive universal linear measurements. We consider Fourier measurements (random sample of frequencies of f) and random Gaussian measurements. The method for reconstruction that has recently gained momentum in the Sparse Approximation Theory is to relax this highly non-convex problem to a convex problem, and then solve it as a linear program. What are best guarantees for the reconstruction problem to be equivalent to its convex relaxation is an open question. Recent work shows that the number of measurements k(r, n) needed to exactly reconstruct any r-sparse signal f of length n from its linear measurements with convex relaxation is usually O(r polylog(n)). However, known guarantees involve huge constants, in spite of very good performance of the algorithms in practice. In attempt to reconcile theory with practice, we prove the first guarantees for universal measurements (i.e. which work for all sparse functions) with reasonable constants. For Gaussian measurements, k(r, n) ? 11.7 r  1.5 + log(n/r)   , which is optimal up to constants. For Fourier measurements, we prove the best known bound k(r, n) = O(r log(n)  · log 2 (r) log(r log n)), which is optimal within the log log n and log 3 r factors. Our arguments are based on the

Our algorithm can access A by reading its values on a sample setT [0;N), chosen randomly from a (non-product) distribution of our choice, independent of A. That is, we sample non-adaptively. The total time cost of the algorithm is polynomial inB log(N) log(M) = (where M is the ratio of largest to smallest numerical quantity encountered), which implies a similar bound for the number of samples. 1.

208|Coda: A Highly Available File System for a Distributed Workstation Environment|Abstract- Coda is a file system for a large-scale distributed computing environment composed of Unix workstations. It provides resiliency to server and network failures through the use of two distinct but complementary mechanisms. One mechanism, server replication,stores copies of a file at multiple servers. The other mechanism, disconnected operation, is a mode of execution in which a caching site temporarily assumes the role of a replication site. Disconnected operation is particularly useful for supporting portable workstations. The design of Coda optimizes for availability and performance, and strives to provide the highest degree of consistency attainable in the light of these objectives. Measurements from a prototype show that the performance cost of providing high availability in Coda is reasonable. Index Terms- Andrew, availability, caching, disconnected operation, distributed file system, performance, portable computers, scalability, server replication. I.
209|Scale and performance in a distributed file system|The Andrew File System is a location-transparent distributed tile system that will eventually span more than 5000 workstations at Carnegie Mellon University. Large scale affects performance and complicates system operation. In this paper we present observations of a prototype implementation, motivate changes in the areas of cache validation, server process structure, name translation, and low-level storage representation, and quantitatively demonstrate Andrews ability to scale gracefully. We establish the importance of whole-file transfer and caching in Andrew by comparing its performance with that of Sun Microsystems NFS tile system. We also show how the aggregation of files into volumes improves the operability of the system.
210|Reliable Communication in the Presence of Failures|The design and correctness of a communication facility for a distributed computer system are reported on. The facility provides support for fault-tolerant process groups in the form of a family of reliable multicast protocols that can be used in both local- and wide-area networks. These protocols attain high levels of concurrency, while respecting application-specific delivery ordering constraints, and have varying cost and performance that depend on the degree of ordering desired. In particular, a protocol that enforces causal delivery orderings is introduced and shown to be a valuable alternative to conventional asynchronous communication protocols. The facility also ensures that the processes belonging to a fault-tolerant process group will observe consistent orderings of events affecting the group as a whole, including process failures, recoveries, migration, and dynamic changes to group properties like member rankings. A review of several uses for the protocols in the ISIS system, which supports fault-tolerant resilient objects and bulletin boards, illustrates the significant simplification of higher level algorithms made possible by our approach.
211|Integrating Security in a Large Distributed System|Andrew is a distributed computing environment that is a synthesis of the personal computing and timesharing paradigms. When mature, it is expected to encompass over 5,000 workstations spanning the Carnegie Mellon University campus. This paper examines the security issues that arise in such an environment and describes the mechanisms that have been developed to address them. These mechanisms include the logical and physical separation of servers and clients, support for secure communication at the remote procedure call level, a distributed authentication service, a file-protection scheme that combines access lists with UNIX mode bits, and the use of encryption as a basic building block. The paper also discusses the assumptions underlying security in Andrew and analyzes the vulnerability of the system. Usage experience reveals that resource control, particularly of workstation CPU cycles, is more important than originally anticipated and that the mechanisms available to address this issue are rudimentary.
212|Optimism and consistency in partitioned distributed database systems|A protocol for transaction processing during partition failures is presented which guarantees mutual consistency between copies of data-items after repair is completed. The protocol is optimistic  in that transactions are processed without restrictions during failure; conflicts are then detected at repair time using a precedence graph, and are resolved by backing out transactions according to some backout strategy. The resulting database state then corresponds to a serial execution of some subset of transactions run during the failure. Results from simulation and probabilistic modeling show that the optimistic protocol is a reasonable alternative in many cases. Conditions under which the protocol performs well are noted, and suggestions are made as to how performance can be improved. In particular, a backout strategy is presented which takes into account individual transaction costs and attempts to minimize total backout cost. Although the problem of choosing transactions to minimize total backout cost is, in general, NP-complete, the backout strategy is efficient and produces very good results.
213|Supplying High Availability with a Standard Network File System|This paper describes the design of a network file service that is tolerant to fail-stop failures and can be run on top of a standard network file service. The fault-tolerance is completely transparent, so the resulting file system supports the same set of heterogeneous workstations and applications as the chosen standard. To demonstrate that our design can provide the benefit of highly available files at a reasonable cost to the user, we implemented a prototype based on the Sun NFS protocol. Our approach is not limited to being used with NFS, however. And, the methodology used should apply to any network file service built along the client-server model. 1 Introduction  There are two approaches to building fault-tolerant distributed programs. The first is to choose an available programming abstraction that reasonably fits the problem at hand (e.g. transactions  (e.g. [7]), replicated procedure calls [4] or reliable objects [2]) and implement the program using the abstraction.

216|Discovering functional formulas through changing representation|This paper deals with computer generation of numerical functional formulas describing results of scientific experiments (measurements). It describes the methodology for generating functional physical laws called COPER (Kokar 1985a). This method generates only so called &#034;meaningful functions&#034;, i.e., such that fulfill some syntactic conditions. In the case of physical laws these conditions are described in the theory of dimensional analysis, which provides rules for grouping arguments of a function into a (smaller) number of dimensionless monomials. These monomials constitute new arguments for which a functional formula is generated. COPER takes advantage of the fact that the grouping is not unique since it depends on which of the initial arguments are chosen as so called &#034;dimensional base&#034; (representation base). For a given functional formula the final result depends on the base. In its search for a functional formula COPER first performs a search through different representation bases for a fixed form of the function before going into more complex functional formulas. It appears that for most of the physical laws only two classes of functional formulas- linear functions and second degree polynomials- need to be considered to generate a formula exactly matching the law under consideration. 1.

The main change in this document relative to RFC 2582 is to specify the Careful variant of NewRenos Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms. The base algorithm described in RFC 2582 did not attempt to avoid unnecessary multiple Fast Retransmits that can occur after a timeout. However, RFC 2582 also defined &#034;Careful&#034; and &#034;Less Careful&#034; variants that avoid these unnecessary Fast Retransmits, and recommended the Careful variant.

218|Dynamics of Random Early Detection|In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of Random Early Detection (RED) over traffic types categorized as nonadaptive, fragile and robust, according to their responses to congestion. We point out that RED allows unfair bandwidth sharing when a mixture of the three traffic types shares a link This urlfairness is caused by the fact that at any given time RED imposes the same loss rate on all jlows, regardless of their bandwidths. We propose Fair Random Early Drop (FRED), a modified version of RED. FRED uses per-active-jlow accounting to impose 011 each flow a loss rate that depends on the flows buffer use. We sl~ow that FRED provides better protection than RED for adaptive uragile and robust) flows. In addition, FRED is able to isolate non-adaptive greedy trafic more effectively. Finally we present a two-packet-buffer  gateway mechanism to support a large number of f7ows without incurring additional queueing delays inside the network These improvements are demonstrated by simulations of TCP and UDP traffic. FRED does not make any assumptions about queueing architecture: it will work with a FIFO gateway. FREDs peractive-jlow accounting uses memory in proportion to the total number of b@fers used: a FRED gateway maintains state only for flows for which it has packets buffered, not for all flows that traverse the gateway, 1.
219|Improving the Start-up Behavior of a Congestion Control Scheme for TCP|Based on experiments conducted in a network simulator and over real networks, this paper proposes changes to the congestion control scheme in current TCP implementations to improve its behavior during the start-up period of a TCP connection.  The scheme, which includes Slow-start, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery algorithms, uses acknowledgments from a receiver to dynamically calculate reasonable operating values for a sender&#039;s TCP parameters governing when and how much a sender can pump into the network. During the startup period, because a TCP sender starts with default parameters, it often ends up sending too many packets and too fast, leading to multiple losses of packets from the same window. This paper shows that recovery from losses during this start-up period is often unnecessarily time-consuming.  In particular, using the current Fast Retransmit algorithm, when multiple packets in the same window are lost, only one of the packet losses may be recovered by each Fast Retransmi...

221|Identifying the TCP Behavior of Web Servers|Most of the traffic in today&#039;s Internet is controlled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Hence, the performance of TCP has a significant impact on the performance of the overall Internet. Since web traffic forms the majority of the TCP traffic, TCP implementations in today&#039;s web servers are of particular interest. However, TCP is a complex protocol with many user-configurable parameters and a range of different implementations. In addition, research continues to produce new developments in congestion control mechanisms and TCP options, and it is useful to trace the deployment of these new mechanisms in the Internet. As a final concern, the stability and fairness of the current Internet relies on the voluntary use of congestion control mechanisms by end hosts. Therefore it is important to test TCP implementations for conformant end-to-end congestion control. We have developed a tool called TCP Behavior Identification Tool (TBIT) to characterize the TCP behavior of a remote web ...
222|TCP and Successive Fast Retransmits| won&#039;t go through the details, but Figure 2 shows the pathological behavior that can result from multiple Fast Retransmits in one roundtrip time.    This work was supported by the Director, Office of Energy Research, Scientific Computing Staff, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC03-76SF00098.  This problem is somewhat more difficult to duplicate in simulations with Reno implementations. With Reno implementations, the source essentially assumes that only one packet has been dropped, retransmits that dropped packet, and instead of waiting for the ACK to be received, continues transmitted new packets. For multiple packet drops in one roundtrip time, the Reno source often has to wait for a retransmit timer to recover (given the absence of Selective ACKs). And in some circumstances with Reno, the ability to have multiple Fast Retransmits in a single roundtrip time can avoid the wait for a retransmit timer timeout, in the absence of Selective ACKs. 
223|A Digital Fountain Approach to Reliable Distribution of Bulk Data|The proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute bulk data to a large number of autonomous clients motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast prot.ocols. We describe an ideal, fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain. A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous clients to acquire bulk data with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing. Moreover, no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery, even in the face of high loss rates. We develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using a new class of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes. We provide performance measurements that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and discuss the design, implementation and performance of an experimental system. 
224|Dissemination-based Data Delivery Using Broadcast Disks|Mobile computers and wireless networks are emerging technologies which promise to make ubiquitous computing a reality. One challenge that must be met in order to truly realize this potential is that of providing mobile clients with ubiquitous access to data. Mobile clients may often be disconnected from stationary server machines or may have only a low-bandwidth channel for sending messages to servers. Such an environment raises difficulties for supporting data-intensive applications for three reasons: 1) the inability to predict, with 100% accuracy, the future data needs of many applications, 2) limits on storage capacities of mobile machines, and 3) the need to provide clients with new or updated data values. One (and perhaps the only) way to address these challenges is to provide stationary server machines with a relatively high-bandwidth channel over which to broadcast data to a client population in anticipation of the need for that data at the clients. Such a system can be said to...
225|Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex|In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and
226|Visual properties of neurons in a polysensory area in superior temporal sulcus of the macaque|dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior por-tion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21 % responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17 % re-sponded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17 % were trimodal, and 41 % were exclu-sively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monoc-ular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of move-ment radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had lit-tle or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and poly-modal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition.
227|Stimulus-selective properties of inferior temporal neurons in the macaque|Previous studies have reported that some neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex respond selectively to highly specific complex objects. In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be detectors  for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex. Inferior temporal (IT) cortex plays a role in visual processing several steps beyond that of the primary visual cortex. Removal
228|A double-labeling investigation of the afferent connectivity to cortical areas V1 and V2 of the macaque monkey|The afferent connectivity of areas Vl and V2 was investigated using the fluorescent dyes fast blue and diamidino yellow. Simultaneous injection of each dye in retinotopically corresponding regions of these areas gave rise to two afferent populations of labeled neurons in subcortical and cortical structures which project to both areas. These two populations showed a variable degree of overlap in their spatial distribution. Neurons labeled by both dyes (double-labeled neurons) which, therefore, project to both areas, were found in substantial numbers in these overlap zones. When the injections were made in non-retinotopically corresponding regions in the two areas, both populations of labeled cells overlapped extensively in the cortex but not in subcortical structures, suggesting that the laws governing the topography of these
229|Power-law distributions in empirical data|Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twentyfour real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.

231|A Random Graph Model for Massive Graphs|  We propose a random graph model which is a special case of sparse random graphs with given degree sequences. This model involves only a small number of parameters, called logsize and log-log growth rate. These parameters capture some universal characteristics of massive graphs. Furthermore, from these parameters, various properties of the graph can be derived. For example, for certain ranges of the parameters, we will compute the expected distribu-tion of the sizes of the connected components which almost surely occur with high probability. We will illustrate the consistency of our model with the behavior of some massive graphs derived from data in telecommunications. We will also discuss the threshold function, the giant component, and the evolution of random graphs in this model.  
232|Collective entity resolution in relational data|Many databases contain uncertain and imprecise references to real-world entities. The absence of identifiers for the underlying entities often results in a database which contains multiple references to the same entity. This can lead not only to data redundancy, but also inaccuracies in query processing and knowledge extraction. These problems can be alleviated through the use of entity resolution. Entity resolution involves discovering the underlying entities and mapping each database reference to these entities. Traditionally, entities are resolved using pairwise similarity over the attributes of references. However, there is often additional relational information in the data. Specifically, references to different entities may cooccur. In these cases, collective entity resolution, in which entities for cooccurring references are determined jointly rather than independently, can improve entity resolution accuracy. We propose a novel relational clustering algorithm that uses both attribute and relational information for determining the underlying domain entities, and we give an efficient implementation. We investigate the impact that different relational similarity measures have on entity resolution quality. We evaluate our collective entity resolution algorithm on multiple real-world databases. We show that it improves entity resolution performance over both attribute-based baselines and over algorithms that consider relational information but do not resolve entities collectively. In addition, we perform detailed experiments on synthetically generated data to identify data characteristics that favor collective relational resolution over purely attribute-based algorithms.
233|Where mathematics meets the Internet|The Internet has experienced a fascinating evolution in the recent past, especially since the early days of the Web, a fact well-documented not only in the trade journals, but also in the popular press. Unprecedented in its growth, unparalleled in its heterogeneity, and unpredictable or even chaotic in the behavior of its tra c, \the Internet is its own revolution&#034;, as Anthony-Michael Rutkowski, former Executive Director of the Internet Society, likes to put it.
234|Problems with fitting to the powerlaw distribution |Abstract. This short communication uses a simple experiment to show that fitting to a power law distribution by using graphical methods based on linear fit on the log-log scale is biased and inaccurate. It shows that using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is far more robust. Finally, it presents a new
235|A Functional Approach to External Graph Algorithms|. We present a new approach for designing external graph algorithms  and use it to design simple external algorithms for computing connected components,  minimum spanning trees, bottleneck minimum spanning trees, and maximal  matchings in undirected graphs and multi-graphs. Our I/O bounds compete  with those of previous approaches. Unlike previous approaches, ours is purely  functional---without side effects---and is thus amenable to standard checkpointing  and programming language optimization techniques. This is an important  practical consideration for applications that may take hours to run.  1 Introduction  We present a divide-and-conquer approach for designing external graph algorithms, i.e., algorithms on graphs that are too large to fit in main memory. Our approach is simple to describe and implement: it builds a succession of graph transformations that reduce to sorting, selection, and a recursive bucketing technique. No sophisticated data structures are needed. We apply our t...
236|Functional and topological characterization of protein interaction networks|The elucidation of the cells large-scale organization is a primary challenge for post-genomic biology, and understanding the structure of protein interaction networks offers an important starting point for such studies. We compare four available databases that approximate the protein interaction network of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aiming to uncover the networks generic large-scale properties and the impact of the proteins  function and cellular localization on the network topology. We show how each database supports a scale-free, topology with hierarchical modularity, indicating that these features represent a robust and generic property of the protein interactions network. We also find strong correlations between the networks structure and the functional role and subcellular localization of its protein constituents, concluding that most functional and/or localization classes appear as relatively segregated subnetworks of the full protein interaction network. The uncovered systematic differences between the four protein interaction databases reflect their relative coverage for different functional and localization classes and provide a guide for their utility in various bioinformatics studies. Keywords: Bioinformatics / Protein interaction networks / Scale-free networks 1
237|On the bias of traceroute sampling: or, power-law degree distributions in regular graphs|Understanding the graph structure of the Internet is a crucial step for building accurate network models and designing efficient algorithms for Internet applications. Yet, obtaining this graph structure can be a surprisingly difficult task, as edges cannot be explicitly queried. For instance, empirical studies of the network of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses typically rely on indirect methods like traceroute to build what are approximately single-source, all-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction of the networks edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empirically that the resulting sample is intrinsically biased. Further, in simulations, they observed that the degree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when the underlying degree distribution is Poisson. In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling mathematically and, for a very general class of underlying degree distributions, explicitly calculate the distribution that will be observed. As example applications of our machinery, we prove that traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions in both d-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our work puts the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends them to nearly arbitrary degree distributions.
238|Currency and commodity metabolites: Their identification and relation to the modularity of metabolic networks|The large-scale shape and function of metabolic networks are intriguing topics of systems biology. Such networks are on one hand commonly regarded as modular (i.e. built by a number of relatively independent subsystems), but on the other hand they are robust in a way not expected of a purely modular system. To address this question we carefully discuss the partition of metabolic networks into subnetworks. The practice of preprocessing such networks by removing the most abundant substrates, currency metabolites, is formalized into a network-based algorithm. We study partitions for metabolic networks of many organisms and find cores of currency metabolites and modular peripheries of what we call commodity metabolites. The networks are found to be more modular than random networks but far from perfectly divisible into modules. We argue that cross-modular edges are the key for the robustness of metabolism. 
239|Likelihood-Based Inference for Stochastic Models of Sexual Network Formation|Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) constitute a major public health concern. Mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of STDs indicate that heterogeneity in sexual activity level allow them to persist even when the typical behavior of the population would not support endemicity. This insight focuses attention on the distribution of sexual activity level in a population. In this paper, we develop several stochastic process models for the f&#039;ormation of sexual partnership networks. Using likelihood-based model selection procedures, we assess the fit of the different models to three large distributions of sexual partner counts: (1) Rakai, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) the USA. Five of&#039; the six single-sex networks were fit best by the negative binomial model. The American women&#039;s network was best fit by a power-law model, the Yule. For most networks, several competing models fit approximately equally well. These results sug- gest three conclusions: (1) no single unitary process clearly underlies the formation of these sexual networks, (2) behavioral heterogeneity plays an essential role in network structure, (3) substantial model uncertainty exists for sexual network degree distributions. Behavioral research focused on the mechanisms of partnership f&#039;ormation will play an essential role in specifying the best model for empirical degree distributions. We discuss the limitations of inferences f&#039;rom such data, and the utility of degree-based epidemiological models more generally.
240|Editorial: The future of power law research |Abstract. I argue that power law research must move from focusing on observation, interpretation, and modeling of power law behavior to instead considering the challenging problems of validation of models and control of systems. 1. The Problem with Power Law Research To begin, I would like to recall a humorous insight from the paper of Fabrikant, Koutsoupias, and Papadimitriou [Fabrikant et al. 01], consisting of this quote and the following footnote. Power laws... have been termed the signature of human activity...  1 The study of power laws, especially in networks, has clearly exploded over the last decade, with seemingly innumerable papers and even popular books, such as Barabásis Linked [Barabási 02] and Watts  Six Degrees [Watts 03]. Power laws are, indeed, everywhere. Despite this remarkable success, I believe that research into power laws in computer networks (and networks more generally) suffers from glaring deficiencies that need to be addressed by the community. Coping with these deficiencies should lead to another great burst of exciting and compelling research. To explain the problem, I would like to make an analogy to the area of string theory. String theory is incredibly rich and beautiful mathematically, with a simple and compelling basic starting assumption: the universes building blocks do not really correspond to (zero-dimensional) points, but to small 1 They are certainly the product of one particular kind of human activity: looking for power laws...  [Fabrikant et al. 01]
241|DYNAMICS OF BAYESIAN UPDATING WITH DEPENDENT DATA AND MISSPECIFIED MODELS|Recent work on the convergence of posterior distributions under Bayesian updating has established conditions under which the posterior will concentrate on the truth, if the latter has a perfect representation within the support of the prior, and under various dynamical assumptions, such as the data being independent and identically distributed or Markovian. Here I establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of the posterior distribution in non-parametric problems even when all of the hypotheses are wrong, and the data-generating process has a complicated dependence structure. The main dynamical assumption is the generalized asymptotic equipartition (or Shannon-McMillan-Breiman) property of information theory. I derive a kind of large deviations principle for the posterior measure, and discuss the advantages of predicting using a combination of models known to be wrong. An appendix sketches connections between the present results and the replicator dynamics of evolutionary theory.  
242|The QQ-Estimator And Heavy Tails|. A common visual technique for assessing goodness of fit and estimating location and scale is the qq--plot. We apply this technique to data from a Pareto distribution and more generally to data generated by a distribution with a heavy tail. A procedure for assessing the presence of heavy tails and for estimating the parameter of regular variation is discussed which can supplement other standard techniques such as the Hill plot. 1. Introduction.  A graphical technique called the qq-plot is a commonly used method of visually assessing goodness of fit and of estimating location and scale parameters. The method is standard and ubiquitious in various forms. See for example Rice (1988) and Castillo (1988). The method is based on the following simple observation: If  U 1;n  U 2;n  : : : U n;n  are the order statistics from n iid observations which are uniformly distributed on [0; 1], then by symmetry E(U i+1;n \Gamma U i;n ) = 1  n + 1 and hence  EU i;n =  i n + 1  :  Thus since U i;n should...

246|Empirical distributions of logreturns: Between the stretched exponential and the power law? Quantitative Finance |A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of empirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, with a tail exponent b close to 3. First, we show by synthetic tests performed on time series with time dependence in the volatility with both Pareto and Stretched-Exponential distributions that for sample of moderate size, the standard generalized extreme value (GEV) estimator is quite inefficient due to the possibly slow convergence toward the asymptotic theoretical distribution and the existence of biases in presence of dependence between data. Thus it cannot distinguish reliably between rapidly and regularly varying classes of distributions. The Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) estimator works better, but still lacks power in the presence of strong dependence. Then, we use a parametric representation of the tail of the distributions of returns of 100 years of daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1 years of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index, encompassing both a regularly varying distribution in one limit of the parameters and rapidly varying distributions of the class of the Stretched-Exponential (SE) and Log-Weibull distributions in other limits. Using the method of nested hypothesis testing (Wilks  theorem),
247|Relational Databases for Querying XML Documents:  Limitations and Opportunities|XML is fast emerging as the dominant standard for representing data in the World Wide Web. Sophisticated query engines that allow users to effectively tap the data stored in XML documents will be crucial to exploiting the full power of XML. While there has been a great deal of activity recently proposing new semistructured data models and query languages for this purpose, this paper explores the more conservative approach of using traditional relational database engines for processing XML documents conforming to Document Type Descriptors (DTDs). To this end, we have developed algorithms and implemented a prototype system that converts XML documents to relational tuples, translates semi-structured queries over XML documents to SQL queries over tables, and converts the results to XML. We have qualitatively evaluated this approach using several real DTDs drawn from diverse domains. It turns out that the relational approach can handle most (but not all) of the semantics of semi-structured queries over XML data, but is likely to be effective only in some cases. We identify the causes for these limitations and propose certain extensions to the relational 
248|The Lorel Query Language for Semistructured Data|We present the Lorel language, designed for querying semistructured data. Semistructured data is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g., in structured documents such as HTML and when performing simple integration of data from multiple sources. Traditional data models and query languages are inappropriate, since semistructured data often is irregular, some data is missing, similar concepts are represented using different types, heterogeneous sets are present, or object structure is not fully known. Lorel is a user-friendly language in the SQL/OQL style for querying such data effectively. For wide applicability, the simple object model underlying Lorel can be viewed as an extension of ODMG and the language as an extension of OQL. The main novelties of the Lorel language are: (i) extensive use of coercion to relieve the user from the strict typing of OQL, which is inappropriate for semistructured data
249|A Query Language and Optimization Techniques for Unstructured Data|A new kind of data model has recently emerged in which the database is not constrained by a conventional schema. Systems like ACeDB, which has become very popular with biologists, and the recent Tsimmis proposal for data integration organize data in tree-like structures whose components can be used equally well to represent sets and tuples. Such structures allow great flexibility in data representation  What query language is appropriate for such structures? Here we propose a simple language UnQL for querying data organized as a rooted, edge-labeled graph. In this model, relational data may be represented as fixed-depth trees, and on such trees UnQL is equivalent to the relational algebra. The novelty of UnQL consists in its programming constructs for arbitrarily deep data and for cyclic structures. While strictly more powerful than query languages with path expressions like XSQL, UnQL can still be efficiently evaluated. We describe new optimization techniques for the deep or &#034;vertical&#034; dimension of UnQL queries. Furthermore, we show that known optimization techniques for operators on flat relations apply to the &#034;horizontal&#034; dimension of UnQL.  
250|Lore: A database management system for semistructured data|Lore (for Lightweight Object Repository) is a DBMS designed specifically for managing semistructured information. Implementing Lore has required rethinking all aspects of a DBMS, including storage management, indexing, query processing and optimization, and user interfaces. This paper provides an overview of these aspects of the Lore system, as well as other novel features such as dynamic structural summaries and seamless access to data from external sources. 
251|Multiple-Query Optimization|Some recently proposed extensions to relational database systems, as well as to deductive database systems, require support for multiple-query processing. For example, in a database system enhanced with inference capabilities, a simple query involving a rule with multiple definitions may expand to more than one actual query that has to be run over the database. It is an interesting problem then to come up with algorithms that process these queries together instead of one query at a time. The main motivation for performing such an interquery optimization lies in the fact that queries may share common data. We examine the problem of multiple-query optimization in this paper. The first major contribution of the paper is a systematic look at the problem, along with the presentation and analysis of algorithms that can be used for multiple-query optimization. The second contribution lies in the presentation of experimental results. Our results show that using multiple-query processing algorithms may reduce execution cost considerably.
252|From Structured Documents to Novel Query Facilities|Structured documents (e.g., SGML) can benefit a lot from database support and more specifically from object-oriented database (OODB) management systems. This paper describes a natural mapping from SGML documents into OODB&#039;s and a formal extension of two OODB query languages (one SQL-like and the other calculus) in order to deal with SGML document retrieval. Although motivated by structured documents, the extensions of query languages that we present are general and useful for a variety of other OODB applications. A key element is the introduction of paths as first class citizens. The new features allow to query data (and to some extent schema) without exact knowledge of the schema in a simple and homogeneous fashion. 1 Introduction  Structured documents are central to a wide class of applications such as software engineering, libraries, technical documentation, etc. They are often stored in file systems and document access tools are somewhat limited. We believe that (object-oriented) d...
253|Optimizing Regular Path Expressions Using Graph Schemas|Query languages for data with irregular structure use regular path expressions for navigation. This feature is useful for querying data where parts of the structure is either unknown, unavailable to the user, or changes frequently. Naive execution of regular path expressions is inefficient, however, because it ignores any structure in the data. We describe two optimization techniques for queries with regular path expressions. Both rely on graph schemas for specifying partial knowledge about the data&#039;s structure. Query pruning uses this structure to restrict navigation to only a fragment of the data; we give an efficient algorithm for rewriting any regular path expression query into a pruned one. Query rewriting using state extents  can eliminate or reduce navigation altogether; it is reminiscent of optimizing relational queries using indices. There may be several ways to optimize a query using state extents; we give a polynomial-space algorithm that finds all such optimizations. For re...
254|Multivalued Dependencies and a New Normal Form for Relational Databases|A new type of dependency, which includes the well-known functional dependencies as a special case, is defined for relational databases. By using this concept, a new (fourth) normal form for relation schemata is defined. This fourth normal form is strictly stronger than Codds im-proved third normal form  (or Boyce-Codd normal form). It is shown that, every relation schema can be decomposed into a family of relation schemata in fourth normal form without loss of information (that is, the original relation can be obtained from the new relations by taking joins). Key words and phrases: database design, multivalued dependency, functional dependency, fourth normal form, 4NF, third normal form, 3NF, Boyce-Codd normal form, normalization, decomposition, relational database
255|A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics|This paper presents a database containing ground truth  segmentations produced by humans for images of a wide variety of natural scenes. We define an error measure which quantifies the consistency between segmentations of differing granularities and find that different human segmentations of the same image are highly consistent. Use of this dataset is demonstrated in two applications: (1) evaluating the performance of segmentation algorithms and (2) measuring probability distributions associated with Gestalt grouping factors as well as statistics of image region properties. 1.
257|Blobworld: A System for Region-Based Image Indexing and Retrieval|. Blobworld is a system for image retrieval based on finding coherent image regions which roughly correspond to objects. Each image is automatically segmented into regions (&#034;blobs&#034;) with associated color and texture descriptors. Querying is based on the attributes of one or two regions of interest, rather than a description of the entire image. In order to make large-scale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions using a tree. Because indexing in the high-dimensional feature space is computationally prohibitive, we use a lower-rank approximation to the high-dimensional distance. Experiments show encouraging results for both querying and indexing. 1 Introduction  From a user&#039;s point of view, the performance of an information retrieval system can be measured by the quality and speed with which it answers the user&#039;s information need. Several factors contribute to overall performance:  -- the time required to run each individual query,  -- the quality (precision/recall) of each i...
258|Independent Component Filters Of Natural Images Compared With Simple Cells In Primary Visual Cortex|this article we investigate to what extent the statistical properties of natural images can be used to understand the variation of receptive field properties of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. The receptive fields of simple cells have been studied extensively (e.g., Hubel &amp; Wiesel 1968, DeValois et al. 1982a, DeAngelis et al. 1993): they are localised in space and time, have band-pass characteristics in the spatial and temporal frequency domains, are oriented, and are often sensitive to the direction of motion of a stimulus. Here we will concentrate on the spatial properties of simple cells. Several hypotheses as to the function of these cells have been proposed. As the cells preferentially respond to oriented edges or lines, they can be viewed as edge or line detectors. Their joint localisation in both the spatial domain and the spatial frequency domain has led to the suggestion that they mimic Gabor filters, minimising uncertainty in both domains (Daugman 1980, Marcelja 1980). More recently, the match between the operations performed by simple cells and the wavelet transform has attracted attention (e.g., Field 1993). The approaches based on Gabor filters and wavelets basically consider processing by the visual cortex as a general image processing strategy, relatively independent of detailed assumptions about image statistics. On the other hand, the edge and line detector hypothesis is based on the intuitive notion that edges and lines are both abundant and important in images. This theme of relating simple cell properties with the statistics of natural images was explored extensively by Field (1987, 1994). He proposed that the cells are optimized specifically for coding natural images. He argued that one possibility for such a code, sparse coding...
259|An Experimental Comparison of Range Image Segmentation Algorithms|A methodology for evaluating range image segmentation algorithms is proposed. This  methodology involves (a) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured  light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (b) a set of defined performance  metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed and noise regions, over- and  under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to objectively  compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research  groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into  planar patches. 
260|Statistics of Natural Images and Models|Large calibrated datasets of `random&#039; natural images have recently become available. These make possible precise and intensive statistical studies of the local nature of images. We report results ranging from the simplest single pixel intensity to joint distribution of 3 Haar wavelet responses. Some of these statistics shed light on old issues such as the near scale-invariance of image statistics and some are entirely new. We fit mathematical models to some of the statistics and explain others in terms of local image features.  1 
261|Image compression via joint statistical characterization in the wavelet domain|We develop a statistical characterization of natural images in the wavelet transform domain. This characterization describes the joint statistics between pairs of subband coefficients at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. We observe that the raw coefficients are nearly decorrelated, but their magnitudes are highly correlated. A linear magnitude predictor coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties accounts for the joint coefficient statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of this model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (Embedded Predictive Wavelet Image Coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. The rate-distortion performance of the coder compares favorably with the current best image coders in the literature. 1
262|Support-vector machines for histogram-based image classification|Abstract  Traditional classification approaches generalize poorly on image classification tasks, because of the high dimensionality of the feature space. This paper shows that support vector machines (SVMs) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x;y)  = e  jx y j with a  1 and b  2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x i! x
263|A Robust Visual Method for Assessing the Relative Performance of Edge-Detection Algorithms| A new method for evaluating edge detection algorithms is presented and applied to measure the relative performance of algorithms by Canny, Nalwa-Binford, Iverson-Zucker, Bergholm, and Rothwell. The basic measure of performance is a visual rating score which indicates the perceived quality of the edges for identifying an object. The process of evaluating edge detection algorithms with this performance measure requires the collection of a set of gray-scale images, optimizing the input parameters for each algorithm, conducting visual evaluation experiments and applying statistical analysis methods. The novel aspect of this work is the use of a visual task and real images of complex scenes in evaluating edge detectors. The method is appealing because, by definition, the results agree with visual evaluations of the edge images.  
264|Origins of Scaling in Natural Images|One of the most robust qualities of our visual world is the scaleinvariance of natural images. Not only has scaling been found in different visual environments, but the phenomenon also appears to be calibration independent. This paper proposes a simple property of natural images which explains this robustness: They are collages of regions corresponding to statistically independent &#034;objects&#034;. Evidence is provided for these objects having a power-law distribution of sizes within images, from which follows scaling in natural images. It is commonly suggested that scaling instead results from edges, each with power spectrum 1/k². This hypothesis is refuted by example. 
265|Statistics of range images|The statistics of range images from natural environments is a largely unexplored eldofresearch. It closely relates to the statistical modeling of the scene geometry in natural environments, and the modeling of optical natural images. We have use d a 3D laser range- nder to collect range images from mixed forest scenes. The images are hereanalyzed with respect to di erent statistics. 1
266|A Framework for performance characterization of intermediate-level grouping modules|AbstractWe present five performance measures to evaluate grouping modules in the context of constrained search and indexing based object recognition. Using these measures, we demonstrate a sound experimental framework, based on statistical ANOVA tests, to compare and contrast three edge based organization modules, namely, those of Etemadi et al., Jacobs, and Sarkar-Boyer in the domain of aerial objects using 50 images. With adapted parameters, the Jacobs module performs overall the best for constraint based recognition. For fixed parameters, the Sarkar-Boyer module is the best in terms of recognition accuracy and indexing speedup. Etemadi et al.s module performs equally well with fixed and adapted parameters while the Jacobs module is most sensitive to fixed and adapted parameter choices. The overall performance ranking of the modules is Jacobs, Sarkar-Boyer, and Etemadi et al. Index TermsPerceptual organization, performance evaluation, analysis of variance, ANOVA, experimental vision, intermediate level computer vision, feature grouping, performance characterization. 1
267|The Curve Indicator Random Field: Curve Organization Via Edge Correlation|Can the organization of local edge measurements into curves be directly related to natural image structure? By viewing curve organization as a statistical estimation problem, we suggest that it can. In particular, the classical Gestalt perceptual organization cues of proximity and good continuation---the basis of many current curve organization systems---can be statistically measured in images. As a prior for our estimation approach we introduce the curve indicator random field. In contrast to other techniques that require contour closure or are based on a sparse set of detected edges, the curve indicator random field emphasizes the short-distance, dense nature of organizing curve elements into (possibly) open curves. Its explicit formulation allows the calculation of its properties such as its autocorrelation. On the one hand, the curve indicator random field leads us to introduce the oriented Wiener filter, capturing the blur and noise inherent in the edge measurement process. On the other, it suggests we seek such correlations in natural images. We present the results of some initial edge correlation measurements that not only confirm the presence of Gestalt cues, but also suggest that curvature has a role in curve organization.
268|Random-Collage Model for Natural Images|. We study a model for scale invariance of natural images based on the idea of images as collages of statistically independent objects. The model takes occlusions into account, and shows an excellent qualitative, and good quantitative agreement with empirical data from natural images. At this point, the random-collage model is the only model which comes close to duplicating the simplest, elementary statistics of natural images --- for example, the scale invariance property, the full co-occurrence statistics of two pixels, and the joint statistics of pairs of Haar wavelet responses.  Keywords: natural images, stochastic model, image statistics, scaling, randomcollage model  1. 
269|A Supervised Approach to the Evaluation of Image Segmentation Methods|Evaluation is an important step in developing a segmentation algorithm for an image analysis system. We first give a review of segmentation evaluation methods, and then demonstrate how a supervised evaluation method based on shape features is used in the development of a segmentation algorithm for fluorescence images of white blood cells.
270|Knowledge and Common Knowledge in a Distributed Environment|: Reasoning about knowledge seems to play a fundamental role in distributed systems. Indeed, such reasoning is a central part of the informal intuitive arguments used in the design of distributed protocols. Communication in a distributed system can be viewed as the act of transforming the system&#039;s state of knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for formalizing and reasoning about knowledge in distributed systems. We argue that states of knowledge of groups of processors are useful concepts for the design and analysis of distributed protocols. In particular, distributed knowledge  corresponds to knowledge that is &#034;distributed&#034; among the members of the group, while  common knowledge corresponds to a fact being &#034;publicly known&#034;. The relationship between common knowledge and a variety of desirable actions in a distributed system is illustrated. Furthermore, it is shown that, formally speaking, in practical systems common knowledge cannot be attained. A number of weaker variants...
271|Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process|The consensus problem involves an asynchronous system of processes, some of which may be unreliable. The problem is for the reliable processes to agree on a binary value. We show &#039;that every protocol for this problem has the possibility of nontermination, even with only one faulty process. By way of contrast, solutions are known for the synchronous case, the &#034;Byzantine Generals&#034; problem.
272|A logic of implicit and explicit belief|As part of an on-going project to understand the found* tions of Knowledge Representation, we are attempting to characterize a kind of belief that forms a more appropriate basis for Knowledge Representation systems than that cap tured by the usual possible-world formalizations begun by Hintikka. In this paper, we point out deficiencies in current semantic treatments of knowledge and belief (including re-cent syntactic approaches) and suggest a new analysis in the form of a logic that avoids these shortcomings and is also more viable computationally. The kind of belief that underlies terms in AI such as Know!-edge Representation  or knowledge base  has never been ade-quately characterized. r As we discuss below, the major existing formal model of belief (originated by Hintikka in [l]) requires the
273|Reasoning about Knowledge and Probability|: We provide a model for reasoning about knowledge and probability together. We allow explicit mention of probabilities in formulas, so that our language has formulas that essentially say &#034;according to agent i, formula  &#039; holds with probability at least b.&#034; The language is powerful enough to allow reasoning about higher-order probabilities, as well as allowing explicit comparisons of the probabilities an agent places on distinct events. We present a general framework for interpreting such formulas, and consider various properties that might hold of the interrelationship between agents&#039; probability assignments at different states. We provide a complete axiomatization for reasoning about knowledge and probability, prove a small model property, and obtain decision procedures. We then consider the effects of adding common knowledge and a probabilistic variant of common knowledge to the language.   A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Second Conference on T...
274|Programming Simultaneous Actions Using Common Knowledge|This work applies the theory of knowledge in distributed systems to the design of efficient fault-tolerant protocols. We define a large class of problems requiring coordinated, simultaneous action in synchronous systems, and give a method of transforming specifications of such problems into protocols that are optimal in all runs: for every possible input to the system and faulty processor behavior, these protocols are guaranteed to perform the simultaneous actions as soon as any other protocol could possibly perform them. This transformation is performed in two steps. In the first step, we extract directly from the problem specification a high-level protocol programmed using explicit tests for common knowledge. In the second step, we carefully analyze when facts become common knowledge, thereby providing a method of efficiently implementing these protocols in many variants of the omissions failure model. In the generalized omissions model, however, our analysis shows that testing for common knowledge is NP-hard. Given the close correspondence between common knowledge and simultaneous actions, we are able to show that no optimal protocol for any such problem can be computationally efficient in this model. The analysis in this paper exposes many subtle differences between the failure models, including the precise point at which this gap in complexity occurs.
275|Algorithmic Knowledge|: The standard model of knowledge in multi-agent systems suffers from what has been called the logical omniscience problem: agents know all tautologies, and know all the logical consequences of their knowledge. For many types of analysis, this turns out not to be a problem. Knowledge is viewed as being ascribed by the system designer to the agents; agents are not assumed to compute their knowledge in any way, nor is it assumed that they can necessarily answer questions based on their knowledge. Nevertheless, in many applications that we are interested in, agents need to act on their knowledge. In such applications, an externally ascribed notion of knowledge is insufficient: clearly an agent can base his actions only on what he explicitly knows. Furthermore, an agent that has to act on his knowledge has to be able to compute this knowledge; we do need to take into account the algorithms available to the agent, as well as the &#034;effort&#034; required to compute knowledge. In this paper, we show...
276|What Can Machines Know? On the Properties of Knowledge in Distributed Systems|It has been argued that knowledge is a useful tool for designing and analyzing  complex systems. The notion of knowledge that seems most relevant in this context  is an external, information-based notion that can be shown to satisfy all the axioms  of the modal logic S5. We carefully examine the properties of this notion of knowledge  and show that they depend crucially, and in subtle ways, on assumptions we  make about the system and about the language used for describing knowledge. We  present a formal model in which we can capture various assumptions frequently  made about systems, such as whether they are deterministic or nondeterministic,  whether knowledge is cumulative (which means that processes never &#034;forget&#034;), and  whether or not the &#034;environment&#034; affects the state transitions of the processes. We  then show that under some assumptions about the system and the language, certain  states of knowledge are not attainable and the axioms of S5 do not completely  characterize the pr...

278|What processes know: definitions and proof methods|The importance of the notion of knowledge in reasoning about distributed systems has been recently pointed out by several works. It has been argued that a distributed computation can be understood and analyzed by considering how it affects the state of knowledge of the system. We show that there are a variety of definitions which can reasonably be applied to what a process can know about he global state. We also move beyond the semantic definitions, and present the first proof methods for proving knowledge asser-tions. Both shared memory and message passing models are considered. 1.
279|What can machines know? on the epistemic properties of machines|Abstract: It has been argued that knowledge is a useful tool for designing and analyzing complex systems in AI. The notion of knowledge that seems most relevant in this context is an external, information-based notion that can be shown to satisfy all the axioms of the modal logic S5. We carefully examine the properties of this notion of knowledge, and show that they depend crucially, and in subtle ways, on assumptions we make about the system. We present a formal model in which we can capture the types of assumptions frequently made about systems (such as whether they are deterministic or nondeterministic, whether knowledge is cumulatiw, and whether or not the environment affects the transitions of the system). We then show that under some assump-tions certain states of knowledge are not attainable, and the axioms of S5 do not completely characterize the properties of knowledge; extra axioms are needed. We provide complete axiomatizations for knowledge in a number of cases of interest. 1.
280|Knowledge consistency: a useful suspension of disbelief|The study of knowledge is of great use in distributed computer systems. It has led to better understanding of existing algorithms for such systems, as well as the development of new knowledge-based algorithm.~. The ability to achieve certain states of knowledge (e.g., common knowledge) provides a powerful tool for designing such algorithms. Un-fortunately, it has been shown that for many systems it is impossible to achieve these states of knowledge. In this paper we consider alternative interpretations of knowl-edge under which these states can be achieved. We explore the notion of consistent interpretations, and show how they can be used to circumvent the known impossibility results in a number of cases. This may lead to greater applicability of knowledge-based algorithms.
281|Portholes: Supporting Awareness in a Distributed Work Group |We are investigating ways in which media space technologies can support distributed work groups through access to information that supports general awareness. Awareness involves knowing who is around, what activities are cxcurring, who is talking with whom, it provides a view of one another in the daily work environments. Awareness may lead to informal interactions, spontaneous connections, and the development of shared cultures-all important aspects of maintaining working relationships which are denied to groups distributed across multiple sites.
282|A Trace-Driven Analysis of the UNIX 4.2 BSD File System|We analyzed the UNIX 4.2 BSD file system by recording userlevel activity in trace files and writing programs to analyze the traces. The tracer did not record individual read and write operations, yet still provided tight bounds on what information was accessed and when. The trace analysis shows that the average file system bandwidth needed per user is low (a few hundred bytes per second). Most of the files accessed are open only a short time and are accessed sequentially. Most new information is deleted or overwritten within a few minutes of its creation. We also wrote a simulator that uses the traces to predict the performance of caches for disk blocks. The moderate-sized caches used in UNIX reduce disk traffic for file blocks by about 50%, but larger caches (several megabytes) can eliminate 90% or more of all disk traffic. With those large caches, large block sizes (16 kbytes or more) result in the fewest disk accesses.  Trace-Driven Analysis of 4.2 BSD File System January 2, 1993 1...
283|A Caching File System for a Programmer&#039;s Workstation|This paper describes a workstation file system that supports a group of cooperating programmers by allowing them both to manage local naming environments and to share consistent versions of collections of software. The file system has access to the workstation&#039;s local disk and to remote file servers, and provides a hierarchical name space that includes the files on both. Local names can refer to local files or be attached to remote files. Remote files, which also may be referred to directly, are immutable and cached on the local disk. The file system is part of the Cedar experimental programming environment at Xerox PARC and has been in use since late 1983.
284|Virtual Time and Global States of Distributed Systems|A distributed system can be characterized by the fact that the global state is distributed and that a common time base does not exist. However, the notion of time is an important concept in every day life of our decentralized &#034;real world&#034; and helps to solve problems like getting a consistent population census or determining the potential causality between events. We argue that a linearly ordered structure of time is not (always) adequate for distributed systems and propose a generalized non-standardmodel of time which consists of vectors of clocks. These clock-vectors arepartially orderedand  form a lattice. By using timestamps and a simple clock update mechanism the structure of causality is represented in an isomorphic way. The new model of time has a close analogy to Minkowski&#039;s relativistic spacetime and leads among others to an interesting characterization of the global state problem. Finally, we present a new algorithm to compute a consistent global snapshot of a distributed system where messages may bereceived out of order.
285|ON DISTRIBUTED SNAPSHOTS|We develop an efficient snapshot algorithm that needs no control messages and does not require channels to be first-in-first-out. We also show that several stable properties (e.g., termination, deadlock) can be detected with uncoordinated distributed snapshots. For such properties, our algorithm can be further simplified.
286|Grid Information Services for Distributed Resource Sharing|Grid technologies enable large-scale sharing of resources within formal or informal consortia of individuals and/or institutions: what are sometimes called virtual organizations. In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and monitoring of resources, services, and computations are challenging problems due to the considerable diversity, large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Consequently, information services are a vital part of any Grid software infrastructure, providing fundamental mechanisms for discovery and monitoring, and hence for planning and adapting application behavior.  We present here an information services architecture that addresses performance, security, scalability, and robustness requirements. Our architecture defines simple low-level enquiry  and registration protocols that make it easy to incorporate individual entities into various information structures, such as aggregate directories that support a variety of different query languages and discovery strategies. These protocols can also be combined with other Grid protocols to construct additional higher-level services and capabilities such as brokering, monitoring, fault detection, and troubleshooting. Our architecture has been implemented as MDS-2, which forms part of the Globus Grid toolkit and has been widely deployed and applied.  
287|Globus: A Metacomputing Infrastructure Toolkit|Emerging high-performance applications require the ability to exploit diverse, geographically distributed resources. These applications use high-speed networks to integrate supercomputers, large databases, archival storage devices, advanced visualization devices, and/or scientific instruments to form networked virtual supercomputers or metacomputers. While the physical infrastructure to build such systems is becoming widespread, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the metacomputing environment poses new challenges for developers of system software, parallel tools, and applications. In this article, we introduce Globus, a system that we are developing to address these challenges. The Globus system is intended to achieve a vertically integrated treatment of application, middleware, and network. A low-level toolkit provides basic mechanisms such as communication, authentication, network information, and data access. These mechanisms are used to construct various higher-level metacomp...
288|Unreliable Failure Detectors for Reliable Distributed Systems|We introduce the concept of unreliable failure detectors and study how they can be used to solve Consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. We characterise unreliable failure detectors in terms of two properties  completeness and accuracy. We show that Consensus can be solved even with unreliable failure detectors that make an infinite number of mistakes, and determine which ones can be used to solve Consensus despite any number of crashes, and which ones require a majority of correct processes. We prove that Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are reducible to each other in asynchronous systems with crash failures; thus the above results also apply to Atomic Broadcast. A companion paper shows that one of the failure detectors introduced here is the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus [Chandra et al. 1992].
290|An Architecture for a Secure Service Discovery Service|The widespread deployment of inexpensive communications technology, computational resources in the networking infrastructure, and network-enabled end devices poses an interesting problem for end users: how to locate a particular network service or device out of hundreds of thousands of accessible services and devices. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a secure Service Discovery Service (SDS). Service providers use the SDS to advertise complex descriptions of available or already running services, while clients use the SDS to compose complex queries for locating these services. Service descriptions and queries use the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to encode such factors as cost, performance, location, and device- or service-specific capabilities. The SDS provides a highlyavailable, fault-tolerant, incrementally scalable service for locating services in the wide-area. Security is a core component of the SDS and, where necessary, communications are both encrypt...
292|A Directory Service for Configuring High-Performance Distributed Computations|High-performance execution in distributed computing environments often requires careful selection and configuration not only of computers, networks, and other resources but also of the protocols and algorithms used by applications. Selection and configuration in turn require access to accurate, up-to-date information on the structure and state of available resources. Unfortunately, no standard mechanism exists for organizing or accessing such information. Consequently, different tools and applications adopt ad hoc mechanisms, or they compromise their portability and performance by using default configurations. We propose a solution to this problem: a Metacomputing Directory Service that provides efficient and scalable access to diverse, dynamic, and distributed information about resource structure and state. We define an extensible data model to represent the information required for distributed computing, and we present a scalable, high-performance, distributed implementation. The dat...

294|Forecasting Network Performance to Support Dynamic Scheduling Using the Network Weather Service|The Network Weather Service is a generalizable and extensible facility designed to provide dynamic resource performance forecasts in metacomputing environments. In this paper, we outline its design and detail the predictive performance of the forecasts it generates. While the forecasting methods are general, we focus on their ability to predict the TCP/IP end-to-end throughput and latency that is attainable by an application using systems located at different sites. Such network forecasts are needed both to support scheduling [5], and by the metacomputing software infrastructure to develop quality-of-service guarantees [10, 17]. Keywords: scheduling, metacomputing, quality-ofservice, statistical forecasting, network performance monitoring  1. Introduction  As network technology advances, the resulting improvements in interprocess communication speeds make it possible to use interconnected but separate computer systems as a high-performance computational platform or metacomputer.

295|Characterizing End-to-End Packet Delay and Loss in the Internet|We use the measured round trip delays of small UDP probe packets sent at regular time intervals to characterize the end-to-end packet delay and loss behavior in the Internet. By varying the interval between probe packets, it is possible to study the structure of the Internet load over different time scales. In this paper, the time scales of interest range from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Our observations agree with results obtained by others using simulation and experimental approaches. For example, our estimates of Internet workload are consistent with the hypothesis of a mix of bulk traffic with larger packet size, and interactive traffic with smaller packet size. The interarrival time distribution for Internet packets is consistent with an exponential distribution. We also observe a phenomenon of compression (or clustering) of the probe packets similar to the acknowledgement compression phenomenon recently observed in TCP. Our results also show interesting and less expected...
296|Autopilot: Adaptive control of distributed applications|With increasing development of applications for heterogeneous, distributed computing grids, the focus of performance analysis has shifted from a posteriori optimization on homogeneous parallel systems to application tuning for heterogeneous resources with time varying availability. This shift has profound implications for performance instrumentation and analysis techniques. Autopilot is a new infrastructure for dynamic performance tuning of heterogeneous computational grids based on closed loop control. This paper describes the Autopilot model of distributed sensors, actuators, and decision procedures, reports preliminary performance benchmarks, and presents a case study in which the Autopilot library is utilized in the development of an adaptive parallel input/output system.  
297|Proxy-Based Authorization and Accounting for Distributed Systems|Despite recent widespread interest in the secure authentication of principals across computer networks there has been considerably less discussion of distributed mechanisms to support authorization and accounting. By generalizing the authentication model to support restricted proxies, both authorization and accounting can be easily supported. This paper presents the proxy model for authorization and shows how the model can be used to support a wide range of authorization and accounting mechanisms. The proxy model strikes a balance between access-control-list and capability-based mechanisms allowing each to be used where appropriate and allowing their use in combination. The paper describes how restricted proxies can be supported using existing authentication methods.   
298|The NetLogger Methodology for High Performance Distributed Systems Performance Analysis|We describe a methodology that enables the real-time diagnosis of performance problems in complex high-performance distributed systems. The methodology includes tools for generating precision event logs that can be used to provide detailed end-to-end application and system level monitoring; a Java agent-based system for managing the large amount of logging data; and tools for visualizing the log data and real-time state of the distributed system. We developed these tools for analyzing a high-performance distributed system centered around the transfer of large amounts of data at high speeds from a distributed storage server to a remote visualization client. However, this methodology should be generally applicable to any distributed system.
299|Locating Objects in Wide-Area Systems|Locating mobile objects in a worldwide system requires a scalable location service. An object can be a telephone or a notebook computer, but also a software or data object, such as a file or an electronic document. Our service strictly separates an object&#039;s name from the addresses where it can be contacted. This is done by introducing a location-independent object handle. An object&#039;s name is bound to its unique object handle, which, in turn, is mapped to the addresses where the object can be contacted. To locate an object, we need only its object handle. We present a scalable location service based on a worldwide distributed search tree that adapts dynamically to an object&#039;s migration pattern to optimize lookups and updates. 
300|A Fault Detection Service for Wide Area Distributed Computations|The potential for faults in distributed computing systems is a significant complicating factor for application developers. While a variety of techniques exist for detecting and correcting faults, the implementation of these techniques in a particular context can be difficult. Hence, we propose a fault detection service designed to be incorporated, in a modular fashion, into distributed computing systems, tools, or applications. This service uses well-known techniques based on unreliable fault detectors to detect and report component failure, while allowing the user to tradeoff timeliness of reporting against false positive rates. We describe the architecture of this service, report on experimental results that quantify its cost and accuracy, and describe its use in two applications, monitoring the status of system components of the GUSTO computational grid testbed and as part of the NetSolve network-enabled numerical solver.
301|Online Prediction of the Running Time of Tasks|We describe and evaluate the Running Time Advisor (RTA), a system that can predict the running time of a compute-bound task on a typical shared, unreserved commodity host. The prediction is computed from linear time series predictions of host load and takes the form of a confidence interval that neatly expresses the error associated with the measurement and prediction processes--- error that must be captured to make statistically valid decisions based on the predictions. Adaptive applications make such decisions in pursuit of consistent high performance, choosing, for example, the host where a task is most likely to meet its deadline. We begin by describing the system and summarizing the results of our previously published work on host load prediction. We then describe our algorithm for computing predictions of running time from host load predictions. Finally, we evaluate the system using over 100,000 randomized testcases run on 39 different hosts.
302| 	 The Architecture of the Remos System       |Remos provides resource information to distributed applications. Its design goals of scalability, flexibility, and portability are achieved through an architecture that allows components to be positioned across the network, each collecting informationabout its local network. To collect information from different types of networks and from hosts on those networks, Remos provides several collectors that use different technologies, such as SNMP or benchmarking. By matching the appropriate collector to each particular network environment and by providing an architecture for distributing the output of these collectors across all querying environments, Remos collects appropriately detailed information at each site and distributes this information where needed in a scalable manner. Prediction services are integrated at the user-level, allowing history-based data collected across the network to be used to generate the predictions needed by a particular user. Remos has been implemented and tested in a variety of networks and is in use in a number of different environments. 
303|A scalable, deployable directory service framework for the internet|This paper describes a directory service framework for the Internet that fits within the approach outlined in the IETFs RFC 1588. This framework consists of a global directory service that enables virtually any local directory service to operate under it. We also include an optimized local directory service, thereby providing a complete solution for Internet directory service. Our approach uses proven Internet technology (e.g., the Domain Name System and Uniform Resource Locators) and successful or promising pieces of other services (e.g., X.500 and WHOIS++). Previous attempts to create a unified Internet directory service, such as X.500, LDAP, WHOIS++, and SOLO, have not been fully accepted because of difficulties in implementation and deployment. Therefore, we designed our approach with ease of implementation and deployment in mind. To that end, our approach attempts to co-opt the installed base making a switch to the new service as seamless as possible.
304|White Paper: A Grid Monitoring Service Architecture (DRAFT)  (2001) |Large distributed systems such as Computational and Data Grids require a substantial amount of monitoring  data be collected for a variety of tasks such as fault detection, performance analysis, performance  tuning, performance prediction, and scheduling. Some tools are currently available and others  are being developed for collecting and forwarding this data. The goal of this paper is to describe a  common architecture with all the major components and their essential interactions in just enough  detail that Grid Monitoring systems that follow the architecture described can easily devise common  APIs and wire protocols. To aid implementation, we also discuss the performance characteristics of a  Grid Monitoring system and identify areas that are critical to proper functioning of the system.
305|Estimating the Support of a High-Dimensional Distribution|Suppose you are given some dataset drawn from an underlying probability  distribution P and you want to estimate a &#034;simple&#034; subset S of input  space such that the probability that a test point drawn from P lies outside of  S is bounded by some a priori specified  between 0 and 1.  We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a  function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement. The  functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially  small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of  the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients  are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by  carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also  provide a preliminary theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of  our algorithm.  The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to  the case of unlabelled d...
306|A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers|A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of classifiaction functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.  
307|Making Large-Scale SVM Learning Practical|Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SV M light1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SV M light V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains.  
308|A tutorial on support vector regression|In this tutorial we give an overview of the basic ideas underlying Support Vector (SV) machines for function estimation. Furthermore, we include a summary of currently used algorithms for training SV machines, covering both the quadratic (or convex) programming part and advanced methods for dealing with large datasets. Finally, we mention some modifications and extensions that have been applied to the standard SV algorithm, and discuss the aspect of regularization from a SV perspective.
309|Making Large-Scale Support Vector Machine Learning Practical|Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM  light1  is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SVM  light  V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains.

311|Kernel principal component analysis|A new method for performing a nonlinear form of Principal Component Analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map; for instance the space of all possible d-pixel products in images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.  
312|Improvements to Platt&#039;s SMO Algorithm for SVM Classifier Design|This paper points out an important source of confusion and ineciency in Platt&#039;s Sequential  Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm that is caused by the use of a single threshold value.  Using clues from the KKT conditions for the dual problem, two threshold parameters are employed  to derive modications of SMO. These modied algorithms perform signicantly faster  than the original SMO on all benchmark datasets tried.  1 Introduction  In the past few years, there has been a lot of excitement and interest in Support Vector Machines[16, 2] because they have yielded excellent generalization performance on a wide range of problems. Recently, fast iterative algorithms that are also easy to implement have been suggested[9,4,7,3,6]. Platt&#039;s Sequential Minimization Algorithm (SMO)[9,11] is an important example. A remarkable feature of SMO is that it is also extremely easy to implement. Comparative testing against other algorithms, done by Platt, have shown that SMO is often much faster and has...
313|An equivalence between sparse approximation and Support Vector Machines|This publication can be retrieved by anonymous ftp to publications.ai.mit.edu. The pathname for this publication is: ai-publications/1500-1999/AIM-1606.ps.Z This paper shows a relationship between two di erent approximation techniques: the Support Vector Machines (SVM), proposed by V.Vapnik (1995), and a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the Basis Pursuit De-Noising algorithm (Chen, 1995 ? Chen, Donoho and Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique which can be derived from the Structural Risk Minimization Principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several di erent approximation schemes, including Radial Basis Functions, algebraic/trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of Multilayer Perceptrons. Basis Pursuit De-Noising is a sparse approximation technique, in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that, if the data are noiseless, the modi ed version of Basis Pursuit De-Noising proposed in this paper is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem. In the appendix we also present a derivation of the SVM technique in the framework of regularization theory, rather than statistical learning theory, establishing a connection between SVM, sparse approximation and regularization theory.
314|Extracting Support Data for a Given Task|We report a novel possibility for extracting a small subset of a data base which contains all the information necessary to solve a given classification task: using the Support Vector Algorithm to train three different types of handwritten digit classifiers, we observed that these types of classifiers construct their decision surface from strongly overlapping small (ß 4%) subsets of the data base. This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task. In addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on the training set and characteristics of the learning machines. This finding is important for cases where the amount of available data is limited. Introduction  in: U. M. Fayyad and R.

315|Kernel Methods and Support Vector Machines|Introduction  Over the past ten years kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes have become a staple for modern statistical estimation and machine learning. The groundwork for this field was laid in the second half of the 20th century by Vapnik and Chervonenkis (geometrical formulation of an optimal separating hyperplane, capacity measures for margin classifiers), Mangasarian (linear separation by a convex function class), Aronszajn (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces), Aizerman, Braverman, and Rozonoer (nonlinearity via kernel feature spaces), Arsenin and Tikhonov (regularization and ill-posed problems), and Wahba (regularization in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces).  However, it took until the early 90s until positive definite kernels became a popular and viable means of estimation. Firstly this was due to the lack of su#ciently powerful hardware, since kernel methods require the computation of the socalled kernel matrix, which requires quadratic storage i
316|Generalization Performance of Regularization Networks and Support . . .|We derive new bounds for the generalization error of kernel machines, such as support vector machines and related regularization networks by obtaining new bounds on their covering numbers. The proofs make use of a viewpoint that is apparently novel in the field of statistical learning theory. The hypothesis class is described in terms of a linear operator mapping from a possibly infinite-dimensional unit ball in feature space into a finite-dimensional space. The covering numbers of the class are then determined via the entropy numbers of the operator. These numbers, which characterize the degree of compactness of the operator, can be bounded in terms of the eigenvalues of an integral operator induced by the kernel function used by the machine. As a consequence, we are able to theoretically explain the effect of the choice of kernel function on the generalization performance of support vector machines.

318|Learning distributions by their density levels: A paradigm for learning without a teacher|We propose a mathematical model for learning the high-density areas of an unknown distribution from (unlabeled) random points drawn according to this distribution. While this type of a learning task has not been previously addressed in the Computational Learnability literature, we believethat this it a rather basic problem that appears in many practical learning scenarios. From a statistical theory standpoint, our model may be viewed as a restricted instance of the fundamental issue of inferring information about a probability distribution from the random samples it generates. From a computational learning angle, what we propose is a new framework of un-supervised concept learning. The examples provided to the learner in our model are not labeled (and are not necessarily all positive or all negative). The only information about their membership is indirectly disclosed to the student through the sampling distribution. We investigate the basic features of the proposed model and provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of such learning tasks. Our main result is that the learnability of a class of distributions in this setting is equivalent to the niteness of the VC-dimension of the class of the high-density areas of these distributions. One direction of the proof involves a reduction of the density-level-learnability to p-concepts learnability, while the su ciency condition is proved through the introduction of a generic learning algorithm.
319|Margin Distribution Bounds on Generalization|A number of results have bounded generalization of a classifier in terms of its margin on the training points. There has been some debate about whether the minimum margin is the best measure of the distribution of training set margin values with which to estimate the generalization. Freund and Schapire [6] have shown how a different function of the margin distribution can be used to bound the number of mistakes of an on-line learning algorithm for a perceptron, as well as an expected error bound. We show that a slight generalization of their construction can be used to give a pac style bound on the tail of the distribution of the generalization errors that arise from a given sample size. 1 Introduction  The idea that a large margin classifier might be expected to give good generalization is certainly not new [5, 12]. Despite this insight it was not until comparatively recently [10] that such a conjecture has been placed on a firm footing in the probably approximately correct (pac) mode...
320|On the Generalisation of Soft Margin Algorithms|Generalisation bounds depending on the margin of a classier are a relatively recent development. They provide an explanation of the performance of state-of-the-art learning systems such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) [12] and Adaboost [24]. The diculty with these bounds has been either their lack of robustness or their looseness. The question of whether the generalisation of a classier can be more tightly bounded in terms of a robust measure of the distribution of margin values has remained open for some time. The paper answers this open question in the armative and furthermore the analysis leads to bounds that motivate the previously heuristic soft margin SVM algorithms as well as justifying the use of the quadratic loss in neural network training algorithms. The results are extended to give bounds for the probability of failing to achieve a target accuracy in regression prediction, with a statistical analysis of Ridge Regression and Gaussian Processes as a special case. The analysis presented in the paper has also lead to new boosting algorithms described elsewhere [7].
321|Kernel Method for Percentile Feature Extraction|A method is proposed which computes a direction in a dataset such  that a specified fraction of a particular class of all examples is separated  from the overall mean by a maximal margin. The projector onto that  direction can be used for class-specific feature extraction. The algorithm  is carried out in a feature space associated with a support vector kernel  function, hence it can be used to construct a large class of nonlinear feature  extractors. In the particular case where there exists only one class,  the method can be thought of as a robust form of principal component  analysis, where instead of variance we maximize percentile thresholds. Finally,  we generalize it to also include the possibility of specifying negative  examples.  1 Introduction and Notation  Suppose we are given two sets of data: a set of points  Z = fz 1 ; : : : ; z t g (1) which we think of as representative of the kind of data that we typically encounter in some problem of interest, and a second set  X = f...
322|Optimistic recovery in distributed systems|Optimistic Recovery is a new technique supporting application-independent transparent recovery from processor failures in distributed systems. In optimistic recovery communication, computation and checkpointing proceed asynchronously. Synchronization is replaced by causal dependency trock-ing, which enables a posteriori reconstruction of a consistent distributed system state following a failure using process rollback and message replay. Because there is no synchronization among computation, communication, and checkpointing, optimistic recovery can tolerate the failure of an arbitrary number of processors and yields better throughput and response time than other general recovery techniques whenever failures are infre-quent.
323|Virtual time|Virtual time is a new paradigm for organizing and synchronizing distributed systems which can be applied to such problems as distributed discrete event simulation and distributed database concur-rency control. Virtual time provides a flexible abstraction of real time in much the same way that virtual memory provides an abstraction of real memory. It is implemented using the Time Warp mechanism, a synchronization protocol distinguished by its reliance on lookahead-rollback, and by its implementation of rollback via antimessages.
324|Guardians and Actions: Linguistic Support for Robust, Distributed Programs| An overview is presented of an integrated programming language and system designed to support the construction and maintenance of distributed programs: programs in which modules reside and execute at communicating, but geographically distinct, nodes. The language is intended to support a class of applications concerned with the manipulation and preservation of long-lived, on-line, distributed data. The language addresses the writing of robust programs that survive hardware failures without loss of distributed information and that provide highly concurrent access to that information while preserving its consistency. Several new linguistic constructs are provided; among them are atomic actions, and modules called guardians that survive node failures.

326|Method for Distributed Transaction Commit and Recovery Using Byzantine Agreement Within Clusters of Processors|to distributed transaction commit. We replace the second phase of one of the commit algorithms of [MoLi83] with Byzantine Agreement, providing certain trade-offs and advantages at the time of commit and providing speed advantages at the time of recovery from failure. The present work differs from that presented in [DoSt82b] by increasing the scope (handing a general tree of processes, and multi-cluster transactions) and by providing an explicit set of recovery algorithms. We also provide a model for classifying failures that allows comparisons to be made among various proposed distributed commit algorithms. The context for our work is the Highly Available Systems project at the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory [AAF-KM83].

331|Dryad: Distributed Data-Parallel Programs from Sequential Building Blocks|Dryad is a general-purpose distributed execution engine for coarse-grain data-parallel applications. A Dryad applica-tion combines computational vertices  with communica-tion channels  to form a dataflow graph. Dryad runs the application by executing the vertices of this graph on a set of available computers, communicating as appropriate through files, TCP pipes, and shared-memory FIFOs. The vertices provided by the application developer are quite simple and are usually written as sequential programs with no thread creation or locking. Concurrency arises from Dryad scheduling vertices to run simultaneously on multi-ple computers, or on multiple CPU cores within a computer. The application can discover the size and placement of data at run time, and modify the graph as the computation pro-gresses to make efficient use of the available resources. Dryad is designed to scale from powerful multi-core sin-gle computers, through small clusters of computers, to data centers with thousands of computers. The Dryad execution engine handles all the difficult problems of creating a large distributed, concurrent application: scheduling the use of computers and their CPUs, recovering from communication or computer failures, and transporting data between ver-tices.
332|The click modular router| Click is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configuration is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Configurations are written in a declarative language that supports user-defined abstractions. This language is both readable by humans and easily manipulated by tools. We present language tools that optimize router configurations and ensure they satisfy simple invariants. Due to Clicks architecture and language, Click router configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has sixteen elements on its forwarding path. We present extensions to this router that support dropping policies, fairness among flows, quality-of-service, and
333|PVM: A Framework for Parallel Distributed Computing|The PVM system is a programming environment for the development and execution of large concurrent or parallel applications that consist of many interacting, but relatively independent, components. It is intended to operate on a collection of heterogeneous computing elements interconnected by one or more networks. The participating processors may be scalar machines, multiprocessors, or special-purpose computers, enabling application components to execute on the architecture most appropriate to the algorithm. PVM provides a straightforward and general interface that permits the description of various types of algorithms (and their interactions), while the underlying infrastructure permits the execution of applications on a virtual computing environment that supports multiple parallel computation models. PVM contains facilities for concurrent, sequential, or conditional execution of application components, is portable to a variety of architectures, and supports certain forms of error dete...
334|Cilk: An Efficient Multithreaded Runtime System|Cilk (pronounced &#034;silk&#034;) is a C-based runtime system for multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the &#034;work&#034; and &#034;critical-path length&#034; of a Cilk computation can be used to model performance accurately. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the computation&#039;s work and critical-path length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of &#034;fully strict&#034; (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time, and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal.

337|Interpreting the Data: Parallel Analysis with Sawzall |Very large data sets often have a flat but regular structure and span multiple disks and machines. Examples include telephone call records, network logs, and web document repositories. These large data sets are not amenable to study using traditional database techniques, if only because they can be too large to fit in a single relational database. On the other hand, many of the analyses done on them can be expressed using simple, easily distributed computations: filtering, aggregation, extraction of statistics, and so on. We present a system for automating such analyses. A filtering phase, in which a query is expressed using a new procedural programming language, emits data to an aggregation phase. Both phases are distributed over hundreds or even thousands of computers. The results are then collated and saved to a file. The designincluding the separation into two phases, the form of the programming language, and the properties of the aggregatorsexploits the parallelism inherent in having data and computation distributed across many machines. 1
338|Programming Parallel Algorithms|In the past 20 years there has been treftlendous progress in developing and analyzing parallel algorithftls. Researchers have developed efficient parallel algorithms to solve most problems for which efficient sequential solutions are known. Although some ofthese algorithms are efficient only in a theoretical framework, many are quite efficient in practice or have key ideas that have been used in efficient implementations. This research on parallel algorithms has not only improved our general understanding ofparallelism but in several cases has led to improvements in sequential algorithms. Unf:ortunately there has been less success in developing good languages f:or prograftlftling parallel algorithftls, particularly languages that are well suited for teaching and prototyping algorithms. There has been a large gap between languages
339|Programmable stream processors|The Imagine Stream Processor is a single-chip programmable media processor with 48 parallel ALUs. At 400 MHz, this translates to a peak arithmetic rate of 16 GFLOPS on single-precision data and 32 GOPS on 16bit fixed-point data. The scalability of Imagines programming model and architecture enable it to achieve such high arithmetic rates. Imagine executes applications that have been mapped to the stream programming model. The stream model decomposes applications into a set of computation kernels that operate on data streams. This mapping exposes the inherent locality and parallelism in the application, and Imagine exploits the locality and parallelism to provide a scalable architecture that supports 48 ALUs on a single chip. This paper presents the Imagine architecture and programming model in the first half, and explores the scalability of the Imagine architecture in the second half. 1.
340|Accelerator: using data parallelism to program GPUs for general-purpose uses|GPUs are difficult to program for general-purpose uses. Programmers can either learn graphics APIs and convert their applications to use graphics pipeline operations or they can use stream programming abstractions of GPUs. We describe Accelerator, a system that uses data parallelism to program GPUs for general-purpose uses instead. Programmers use a conventional imperative programming language and a library that provides only high-level data-parallel operations. No aspects of GPUs are exposed to programmers. The library implementation compiles the data-parallel operations on the fly to optimized GPU pixel shader code and API calls. We describe the compilation techniques used to do this. We evaluate the effectiveness of using data parallelism to program GPUs by providing results for a set of compute-intensive benchmarks. We compare the performance of Accelerator versions of the benchmarks against hand-written pixel shaders. The speeds of the Accelerator versions are typically within 50 % of the speeds of hand-written pixel shader code. Some benchmarks significantly outperform C versions on a CPU: they are up to 18 times faster than C code running on a CPU.
341|Using Cohort Scheduling to Enhance Server Performance|A server application is commonly organized as a collection of concurrent threads, each of which executes the code necessary to process a request. This software architecture, which causes frequent control transfers between unrelated pieces of code, decreases instruction and data locality, and consequently reduces the effec- tiveness of hardware mechanisms such as caches, TLBs, and branch predictors. Numerous measurements demonstrate this effect in server applications, which often utilize only a fraction of a modern processor&#039;s computational throughput.
342|The CODE 2.0 Graphical Parallel Programming Language |CODE 2.0 is a graphical parallel programming system that targets the three goals of ease of use, portability, and production of efficient parallel code. Ease of use is provided by an integrated graphical/textual interface, a powerful dynamic model of parallel computation, and an integrated concept of program component reuse. Portability is approached by the declarative expression of synchronization and communication operators at a high level of abstraction in a manner which cleanly separates overall computation structure from the primitive sequential computations that make up a program. Execution efficiency is approached through a systematic class hierarchy that supports hierarchical translation refinement including special case recognition. This paper reports results obtained through experimental use of a prototype implementation of the CODE 2.0 system. CODE 2.0 represents a major conceptual advance over its predecessor systems (CODE 1.0 and CODE 1.2) in terms of the expressive power ...
343|Stream Computations Organized for Reconfigurable Execution (SCORE): Introduction and Tutorial  (2000) |A primary impediment to wide-spread exploitation of reconfigurable computing is the lack of a unifying computational model which allows application portability and longevity without sacrificing a substantial fraction of the raw capabilities. We introduce SCORE (Stream Computation Organized for Reconfigurable Execution), a streambased compute model which virtualizes reconfigurable computing resources (compute, storage, and communication) by dividing a computation up into fixed-size &#034;pages&#034; and time-multiplexing the virtual pages on available physical hardware. Consequently, SCORE applications can scale up or down automatically to exploit a wide range of hardware sizes. We hypothesize that the SCORE model will ease development and deployment of reconfigurable applications and expand the range of applications which can benefit from reconfigurable execution. Further, we believe that a well engineered SCORE implementation can be efficient, wasting little of the capabilities of the raw hardw...
344|Paralex: An Environment for Parallel Programming in Distributed Systems|Modern distributed systems consisting of powerful workstations and high-speed interconnection networks are an economical alternative to special-purpose super computers. The technical issues that need to be addressed in exploiting the parallelism inherent in a distributed system include heterogeneity, high-latency communication, fault tolerance and dynamic load balancing. Current software systems for parallel programming provide little or no automatic support towards these issues and require users to be experts in fault-tolerant distributed computing. The Paralex system is aimed at exploring the extent to which the parallel application programmer can be liberated from the complexities of distributed systems. Paralex is a complete programming environment and makes extensive use of graphics to define, edit, execute and debug parallel scientific applications. All of the necessary code for distributing the computation across a network and replicating it to achieve fault tolerance and dynamic load balancing is automatically generated by the system. In this paper we give an overview of Paralex and present our experiences with a prototype implementation.
345|Parallel and Distributed Haskells|Parallel and distributed languages specify computations on multiple processors and have a computation language to describe the algorithm, i.e. what to compute, and a coordination language to describe how to organise the computations across the processors. Haskell has been used as the computation language for a wide variety of parallel and distributed languages, and this paper is a comprehensive survey of implemented languages. We outline parallel and distributed language concepts and classify Haskell extensions using them. Similar example programs are used to illustrate and contrast the coordination languages, and the comparison is facilitated by the common computation language. A lazy language is not an obvious choice for parallel or distributed computation, and we address the question of why Haskell is a common functional computation language.
346|Highly Available, Fault-Tolerant, Parallel Dataflows|We present a technique that masks failures in a cluster to provide high availability and fault-tolerance for long-running, parallelized dataflows. We can use these dataflows to implement a variety of continuous query (CQ) applications that require high-throughput, 24x7 operation. Examples include network monitoring, phone call processing, click-stream processing, and online financial analysis. Our main contribution is a scheme that carefully integrates traditional query processing techniques for partitioned parallelism with the process-pairs approach for high availability. This delicate integration allows us to tolerate failures of portions of a parallel dataflow  without sacrificing result quality. Upon failure, our technique provides quick fail-over, and automatically recovers the lost pieces on the fly. This piecemeal recovery provides minimal disruption to the ongoing dataflow computation and improved reliability as compared to the straight-forward application of the process-pairs technique on a per dataflow basis. Thus, our technique provides the high availability necessary for critical CQ applications. Our techniques are encapsulated in a reusable dataflow operator called Flux, an extension of the Exchange that is used to compose parallel dataflows. Encapsulating the fault-tolerance logic into Flux minimizes modifications to existing operator code and relieves the burden on the operator writer of repeatedly implementing and verifying this critical logic. We present experiments illustrating these features with an implementation of Flux in the TelegraphCQ code base [8].
347|A comparison of stream-oriented high availability algorithms|Recently, significant efforts have focused on developing novel data-processing systems to support a new class of applications that commonly require sophisticated and timely processing of high-volume data streams. Early work in stream processing has primarily focused on streamoriented languages and resource-constrained, one-pass query-processing. High availability, an increasingly important goal for virtually all data processing systems, is yet to be addressed. In this paper, we first describe how the standard highavailability approaches used in data management systems can be applied to distributed stream processing. We then propose a novel stream-oriented approach that exploits the unique data-flow nature of streaming systems. Using analysis and a detailed simulation study, we characterize the performance of each approach and demonstrate that the stream-oriented algorithm significantly reduces runtime overhead at the expense of a small increase in recovery time. 1
348|Estimating Continuous Distributions in Bayesian Classifiers|When modeling a probability distribution with a Bayesian network, we are faced with the problem of how to handle continuous variables. Most previous work has either solved the problem by discretizing, or assumed that the data are generated by a single Gaussian. In this paper we abandon the normality assumption and instead use statistical methods for nonparametric density estimation. For a naive Bayesian classifier, we present experimental results on a variety of natural and artificial domains, comparing two methods of density estimation: assuming normality and modeling each conditional distribution with a single Gaussian; and using nonparametric kernel density estimation. We observe large reductions in error on several natural and artificial data sets, which suggests that kernel estimation is a useful tool for learning Bayesian models. In Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, 1995 1 Introduction In rec...
349|Generalized Additive Models|Likelihood based regression models, such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariate effects. We introduce the Local Scotinq procedure which replaces the liner form C Xjpj by a sum of smooth functions C Sj(Xj)a The Sj(.) s are unspecified functions that are estimated using scatterplot smoothers. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of Generalized Linear Models contains many of these. In this class, the Locul Scoring procedure replaces the linear predictor VI = C Xj@j by the additive predictor C ai ( hence, the name Generalized Additive Modeb. Local Scoring can also be applied to non-standard models like Coxs proportional hazards model for survival data. In a number of real data examples, the Local Scoring procedure proves to be useful in uncovering non-linear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e. no detective work  is needed on the part of the statistician. In a further generalization, the technique is modified to estimate the form of the link function for generalized linear models. The Local Scoring procedure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to Local Likelihood estimation, another technique for estimating smooth covariate functions. They are seen to produce very similar results with real data, with Local Scoring being considerably faster. As a theoretical underpinning, we view Local Scoring and Local Likelihood as empirical maximizers of the ezpected log-likelihood, and this makes clear their connection to standard maximum likelihood estimation. A method for estimating the degrees of freedom of the procedures is also given.
350|A Bayesian method for the induction of probabilistic networks from data|This paper presents a Bayesian method for constructing probabilistic networks from databases. In particular, we focus on constructing Bayesian belief networks. Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.
351|Learning Bayesian networks: The combination of knowledge and statistical data|We describe scoring metrics for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data. We identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parameter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a users prior knowledge. In particular, a user can express his knowledgefor the most partas a single prior Bayesian network for the domain. 1
352|The CN2 Induction Algorithm|Systems for inducing concept descriptions from examples are valuable tools for  assisting in the task of knowledge acquisition for expert systems. This paper presents  a description and empirical evaluation of a new induction system, cn2, designed for  the efficient induction of simple, comprehensible production rules in domains where  problems of poor description language and/or noise may be present. Implementations  of the cn2, id3 and aq algorithms are compared on three medical classification tasks.   
353|Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem|We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.
354|Supervised and unsupervised discretization of continuous features|Many supervised machine learning algorithms require a discrete feature space. In this paper, we review previous work on continuous feature discretization, identify de n-ing characteristics of the methods, and conduct an empirical evaluation of several methods. We compare binning, an unsupervised discretization method, to entropy-based and purity-based methods, which are supervised algorithms. We found that the performance of the Naive-Bayes algorithm signi cantly improved when features were discretized using an entropy-based method. In fact, over the 16 tested datasets, the discretized version of Naive-Bayes slightly outperformed C4.5 on average. We also show that in some cases, the performance of the C4.5 induction algorithm signi cantly improved if features were discretized in advance ? in our experiments, the performance never signi cantly degraded, an interesting phenomenon considering the fact that C4.5 is capable of locally discretizing features. 1
355|An analysis of Bayesian classifiers|In this paper we present anaverage-case analysis of the Bayesian classifier, a simple induction algorithm that fares remarkably well on many learning tasks. Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting
356|Operations for Learning with Graphical Models|This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper conclu...
357|Induction of Selective Bayesian Classifiers|In this paper, we examine previous work on the naive Bayesian classifier and review its limitations, which include a sensitivity to correlated features. We respond to this problem by embedding the naive Bayesian induction scheme within an algorithm that carries out a greedy search through the space of features. We hypothesize that this approach will improve asymptotic accuracy in domains that involve correlated features without reducing the rate of learning in ones that do not. We report experimental results on six natural domains, including comparisons with decision-tree induction, that support these hypotheses. In closing, we discuss other approaches to extending naive Bayesian classifiers and outline some directions for future research.
358|Inductive and Bayesian learning in medical diagnosis|Abstract. Although successful in medical diagnostic problems, inductive learning systems were not widely accepted in medical practice. In this paper two di erent approaches to machine learning in medical appli-cations are compared: the system for inductive learning of decision trees Assistant, and the naive Bayesian classi er. Both methodologies were tested in four medical diagnostic problems: localization of primary tumor, prognostics of recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosis of thyroid diseases, and rheumatology. The accuracy of automatically acquired diagnostic knowledge from stored data records is compared and the interpretation of the knowledge and the explanation ability of the classi cation process of each system is discussed. Surprisingly, thenaiveBayesian classi er is superior to Assistant in classi cation accuracy and explanation ability, while the interpretation of the acquired knowledge seems to be equally valuable. In ad-dition, two extensions to naive Bayesian classi er are brie y described: dealing with continuous attributes, and discovering the dependencies among attributes.
359|Learning Bayesian Networks Using Feature Selection|This paper introduces a novel enhancement for learning Bayesian networks with a bias for small, high-predictive-accuracy networks. The new approach selects a subset of features which maximizes predictive accuracy prior to the network learning phase. We examine explicitly the effects of two aspects of the algorithm, feature selection and node ordering. Our approach generates networks which are computationally simpler to evaluate and which display predictive accuracy comparable to that of Bayesian networks which model all attributes. 1 INTRODUCTION  Bayesian networks are being increasingly recognized as an important representation for probabilistic reasoning. For many domains, the need to specify the probability distributions for a Bayesian network is considerable, and learning these probabilities from data using an algorithm like K2 [8]  1  could alleviate such specification difficulties. We describe an extension to the Bayesian network learning approaches introduced in K2. Rather than ...
361|The Globus Project: A Status Report|The Globus project is a multi-institutional research e#ort that seeks to enable the construction of computational grids providing pervasive, dependable, and consistent access to high-performance computational resources, despite geographical distribution of both resources and users. Computational grid technology is being viewed as a critical element of future highperformance computing environments that will enable entirely new classes of computation-oriented applications, much as the World Wide Web fostered the development of new classes of information-oriented applications. In this paper, we report on the status of the Globus project as of early 1998. We describe the progress that has been achieved to date in the development of the Globus toolkit, a set of core services for constructing grid tools and applications. We also discuss on the Globus Ubiquitous Supercomputing Testbed (GUSTO) that we have constructed to enable largescale evaluation of Globus technologies, and review early exp...
362|Measuring Bottleneck Link Speed in Packet-Switched Networks|The quality of available network connections can often have a large impact on the performance of distributed applications. For example, document transfer applications such as FTP, Gopher and the World Wide Web suffer increased response times as a result of network congestion. For these applications, the document transfer time is directly related to the available bandwidth of the connection. Available bandwidth depends on two things: 1) the underlying capacity of the path from client to server, which is limited by the bottleneck link; and 2) the amount of other traffic competing for links on the path. If measurements of these quantities were available to the application, the current utilization of connections could be calculated. Network utilization could then be usedasabasis for selection from a set of alternative connections or servers, thus providing reduced response time. Such a dynamic server selection scheme would beespecially important in a mobile computing environment in which the set of available servers is frequently changing. In order to

This project has been motivated by the need for an easy-to-use, efficient mechanism for using computational resources remotely. Ease of use is obtained as a result of different interfaces, some of which do not require any programming effort from the user. Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to use the computational resource available as efficiently as possible.

364|Dynamically Forecasting Network Performance Using the Network Weather Service|this paper, we outline its design and detail the predictive performance of the forecasts it generates. While the forecasting methods are general, we focus on their ability to predict the TCP/IP end-to-end throughput and latency that is attainable by an application using systems located at different sites. Such network forecasts are needed both to support scheduling [5], and by the metacomputing software infrastructure to develop quality-of-service guarantees [10, 17]. Keywords: scheduling, metacomputing, quality-of-service, statistical forecasting, network performance monitoring
365|Dynamic Server Selection using Bandwidth Probing in Wide-Area Networks|Replication is a commonly proposed solution to problems of scale associated with distributed services. However, when a service is replicated, each client must be assigned a server. Prior work has generally assumed that assignment to be static. In contrast, we propose dynamic server selection, and show that it enables application-level congestion avoidance. To make
366|Implementing a Performance Forecasting System for Metacomputing: The Network Weather Service|In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a system called the  Network Weather Service (NWS) that takes periodic measurements of deliverable resource performance from distributed networked resources, and uses numerical models to dynamically generate forecasts of future performance levels. These performance forecasts, along with measures of performance fluctuation (e.g. the mean square prediction error) and forecast lifetime that the NWS generates, are made available to schedulers and other resource management mechanisms at runtime so that they may determine the quality-of-service that will be available from each resource. We describe the architecture of the NWS and implementations that we have developed and are currently deploying for the Legion [13] and Globus/Nexus [7] metacomputing infrastructures. We also detail NWS forecasts of resource performance using both the Legion and Globus/Nexus implementations. Our results show that simple forecasting techniques substanti...
367|Resource Management in Legion|The recent development of gigabit networking technology, combined with the proliferation  of low-cost, high-performance microprocessors, has given rise to metacomputing  environments. These environments can combine many thousands of hosts, from hundreds  of administrative domains, connected by transnational and world-wide networks.  Managing the resources in such a system is a complex task, but is necessary to efficiently  and economically execute user programs.  In this paper, we describe the resource management portions of the Legion metacomputing  system, including the basic model and its implementation. These mechanisms  are flexible both in their support for system-level resource management but also  in their adaptability for user-level scheduling policies. We show this by implementing  a simple scheduling policy and demonstrating how it can be adapted to more complex  algorithms.  Keywords: parallel and distributed systems, task scheduling, resource management,  autonomy  Topic A...
368|ReMoS: A Resource Monitoring System for Network-Aware Applications|Development of portable network-aware applications demands an interface to the network that allows an application to obtain information about its execution environment. This paper motivates and describes the design of Remos, an API that allows network-aware applications to obtain relevant information. The major challenges in defining a uniform interface are network heterogeneity, diversity in traffic requirements, variability of the information, and resource sharing in the network. Remos addresses these issues with two abstraction levels, explicit management of resource sharing, and statistical measurements. The flows abstraction captures the communication between nodes, and the topologies abstraction provides a logical view of network connectivity. Remos measurements are made at network level, and therefore information to manage sharing of resources is available. Remos is designed to deliver best effort information to applications, and it explicitly adds statistical reliability and variability measures to the core information. The paper also presents preliminary results and experience with a prototype Remos implementation for a high speed IP-based network testbed.
369|The Performance of a Service for Network-Aware Applications|This paper evaluates the performance of topology-d, a service for applications that require knowledge of the underlying communication and computing infrastructure in order to deliver adequate performance. Topologyd estimates the state of the network and networked resources by periodically computing end-to-end latency and available bandwidth. Using its estimates, topology-d computes a fault tolerant, high bandwidth, low delay topology connecting participating sites. Topologies are periodically re-computed to take into account network and server load dynamics. Network-aware applications can then make use of topology-d&#039;s estimates and logical topologies to ensure they get adequate service from the underlying network and computing infrastructure. We deployed topology-d on 27 Internet sites throughout the world and collected latency, bandwidth and topology information for a period of two and a half months. The results of these Internet-wide experiments show that topology-d&#039;s estimates compa...
370|Towards a Hierarchical Scheduling System for Distributed WWW Server Clusters|In this paper we present a model for dynamically scheduling HTTP requests across clusters of servers, optimizing the use of client resources as well as the scattered server nodes. We also present a system, H-SWEB, implementing our techniques and showing experimental improvements of over 250%, which have been achieved through utilizing a global approach to scheduling requests. This is the first system to provide a hierarchical scheduling mechanism for distributed HTTP server clusters incorporating dynamic client-server task distribution and distributed data access. H-SWEB uses sophisticated scheduling techniques in monitoring and adapting to workload variation at the client and server clusters for supporting typical digital library tasks, such as fast WWW image browsing. We provide a discussion of our system architecture and implementation, and briefly summarize the experimental results that have been achieved.

372|U-Net: A User-Level Network Interface for Parallel and Distributed Computing|The U-Net communication architecture provides processes with a virtual view of a network interface to enable userlevel access to high-speed communication devices. The architecture, implemented on standard workstations using offthe-shelf ATM communication hardware, removes the kernel from the communication path, while still providing full protection. The model presented by U-Net allows for the construction of protocols at user level whose performance is only limited by the capabilities of network. The architecture is extremely flexible in the sense that traditional protocols like TCP and UDP, as well as novel abstractions like Active Messages can be implemented efficiently. A U-Net prototype on an 8-node ATM cluster of standard workstations offers 65 microseconds round-trip latency and 15 Mbytes/sec bandwidth. It achieves TCP performance at maximum network bandwidth and demonstrates performance equivalent to Meiko CS-2 and TMC CM-5 supercomputers on a set of Split-C benchmarks. 1
373|A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application Level Framing|This paper... reliable multicast framework for application level framing and light-weight sessions. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been prototype in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the 1P multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. Whh the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies. 
374|Active Messages: a Mechanism for Integrated Communication and Computation|The design challenge for large-scale multiprocessors is (1) to minimize communication overhead, (2) allow communication to overlap computation, and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost/performance. We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead, but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages, show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2 and CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C. We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern. Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors.  
375|An Analysis of TCP Processing Overhead|networks, have been getting faster, perceived throughput at the application has not always increased accordingly. Various performance bottlenecks have been encountered, each of which has to be analyzed and corrected. One aspect of networking often suspected of contributing to low throughput is the transport layer of the protocol suite. This layer, especially in connectionless protocols, has considerable functionality, and is typically executed in software by the host processor at the end points of the network. It is thus a likely source of processing overhead. While this theory is appealing, a preliminary examination suggested to us that other aspects of networking may be a more serious source of overhead. To test this proposition, a detailed study was made of a popular transport protocol, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [I]. This paper provides results of that
376|Fbufs: A High-Bandwidth Cross-Domain Transfer Facility|We have designed and implemented a new operating system facility for I/O buffer management and data transfer across protection domain boundaries on shared memory machines. This facility, called fast buffers (fbufs), combines virtual page remapping with shared virtual memory, and exploits locality in I/O traffic to achieve high throughput withoutcompromising protection, security, or modularity. Its goal is to help deliver the high bandwidth afforded by emerging high-speed networks to user-level processes, both in monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems.  This paper outlines the requirements for a cross-domain transfer facility, describes the design of the fbuf mechanism that meets these requirements, and experimentally quantifies the impact of fbufs on network performance. 1 Introduction  Optimizing operations that cross protection domain boundaries has received a great deal of attention recently [2, 3]. This is because an efficient cross-domain invocation facility enables a ...
377|Dynamics of TCP Traffic over ATM Networks|We investigate the performance of TCP connections over ATM networks without ATM-level congestion control, and compare it to the performance of TCP over packet-based networks. For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from `corrupted&#039; packets, i.e., packets in which at least one cell is dropped by the switch. We investigate two packet discard strategies which alleviate the effects of fragmentation. Partial Packet Discard, in which remaining cells are discarded after one cell has been dropped from a packet, somewhat improves throughput. We introduce Early Packet Discard, a strategy in which the switch drops whole packets prior to buffer overflow. This mechanism prevents fragmentation and restores throughput to maximal levels.  
378|Experiences with a High-Speed Network Adaptor: A Software Perspective|This paper describes our experiences, from a software perspective, with the OSIRIS network adaptor. It first identifies the problems we encountered while programming OSIRIS and optimizing network performance, and outlines how we either addressed them in the software, or had to modify the hardware. It then describes the opportunities provided by OSIRIS that we were able to exploit in the host operating system (OS); opportunities that suggested techniques for making the OS more effective in delivering network data to application programs. The most novel of these techniques, called application device channels, gives application programs running in user space direct access to the adaptor. The paper concludes with the lessons drawn from this work, which we believe will benefit the designers of future network adaptors. 1 Introduction  With the emergence of high-speed network facilities, several research efforts are focusing on the design and implementation of network adaptors [5, 2, 3, 16, 2...
379|Protocol Service Decomposition for High-Performance Networking|In this paper we describe a new approach to implementing network protocols that enables them to have high performance and high flexibility, while retaining complete conformity to existing application programming interfaces. The key insight behind our work is that an application&#039;s interface to the network is distinct and separable from its interface to the operating system. We have separated these interfaces for two protocol implementations, TCP/IP and UDP/IP, running on the Mach 3.0 operating system and UNIX server. Specifically, library code in the application&#039;s address space implements the network protocols and transfers data to and from the network, while an operating system server manages the heavyweight abstractions that applications use when manipulating the network through operations other than send and receive. On DECstation 5000/200 This research was sponsored in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Information Science and Technology Office, under the title &#034;Research...
380|The importance of Non-Data Touching Processing Overheads|We present detailed measurements of various processing overheads of the TCP/IP and UDP/IP protocol stacks on a DECstation 5000/200 running the Ultrix 4.2a operating system. These overheads include data-touching operations, such as the checksum computation and data movemen ~ which are well known to be major time consumers. In this stud y, we also considered overheads due to non-data touching operations, such as network buffer manipulation, protocol-specific processing, operating system functions, data structure manipulations (other than network buffers), and error checking. We show that when one considers realistic message size dktributions, where the majority of messages are small, the cumulative time consumed by the nondata touching overheads represents the majority of processing time. We assert that it will be difficult to significantly reduce the cumulative processing time due to non-data touching overheads. The goal of this study is to determine the relative importance of various processing overheads in network software, in particular, the TCP/IP and UDPAP protocol stacks. In the prrsg significant focus has been placed on maximizing throughput noting that data
381|Distributed Network Computing over Local ATM Networks|Communication between processors has long been the bottleneck of distributed network computing. However, recent progress in switch-based high-speed Local Area Networks (LANs) may be changing this situation. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is one of the most widely-accepted and emerging high-speed network standards which can potentially satisfy the communication needs of distributed network computing. In this paper, we investigate distributed network computing over local ATM networks. We first study the performance characteristics involving end-to-end communication in an environment that includes several types of workstations interconnected via a Fore Systems&#039; ASX-100 ATM Switch. We then compare the communication performance of four different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The four APIs were Fore Systems ATM API, BSD socket programming interface, Sun&#039;s Remote Procedure Call (RPC), and the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) message passing library. Each API represents distribute...
382|Separating Data and Control Transfer in Distributed Operating Systems|Advances in processor architecture and technology have resulted in workstations in the 100+ MIPS range. As well, newer local-area networks such as ATM promise a ten- to hundred-fold increase in throughput, much reduced latency, greater scalability, and greatly increased reliability, when compared to current LANs such as Ethernet. We believe that these new network and processor technologies will permit tighter coupling of distributed systems at the hardware level, and that distributed systems software should be designed to benefit from that tighter coupling. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of structuring distributed systems that takes advantage of a communication model based on remote network access (reads and writes) to protected memory segments. A key feature of the new structure, directly supported by the communication model, is the separation of data transfer and control transfer. This is in contrast to the structure of traditional distributed systems, which are typical...
383|Protocol Implementation Using Integrated Layer Processing|Integrated Layer Processing (ILP) is an implementation concept which &amp;quot;permit[s] the implementor the option of performing all the [data] manipulation steps in one or two integrated processing loops &amp;quot; [1]. To estimate the achievable benefits of ILP, a file transfer application with an encryption function on top of a user-level TCP has been implemented and the performance of the application in terms of throughput and packet processing times has been measured. The results show that it is possible to obtain performance benefits by integrating marshalling, encryption and TCP checksum calculation. They also show that the benefits are smaller than in simple experiments, where ILP effects have not been evaluated in a complete protocol environment. Simulations of memory access and cache hit rate show that the main benefit of ILP is reduced memory accesses rather than an improved cache hit rate. The results further show that data manipulation characteristics may significantly influence the cache behavior and the achievable performance gain of ILP. 1
384|User-space protocols deliver high performance to applications on a low-cost gb/s lan|Two important questions in high-speed networking are firstly, how to provide GbitJs networking at low cost and secondly, how to provide a flexible low-level network inter-face so that applications can control their data from the instant it arrives. We describe some work that addresses both of these ques-tions. The Jetstream Gbit/s LAN is an experimental, low-cost network interface that provides the services required by delay-sensitive traffic as well as meeting the performance needs of current applications. Jetstream is a combination of traditional shared-medium LAN technology and more recent ATM cell- and switch-based technology. Jetstream frames contain a channel identifier so that the net-work driver can immediately associate an incoming frame with its application. We have developed such a driver that enables applications to control how their data should be managed without the need to first move the data into the applications address space. Consequently, applications can elect to read just a part of a frame and then instruct the driver to move the remainder directly to its destination. Individual channels can elect to receive frames that have failed their CRC, while applications can specify frame-drop policies on a per-channel basis. Measured results show that both kernel- and user-space pro-tocols can achieve very good throughput: applications using both TCP and our own reliable byte-stream protocol have demonstrated throughputs in excess of 200 Mbit/s. The ben-efits of running protocols in user-space are well known- the drawback has often been a severe penalty in the perform-ance achieved. In this paper we show that it is possible to have the best of both worlds.

385|Experience with Active Messages on the Meiko CS-2|Active messages provide a low latency communication architecture which on modern parallel machines achieves more than an order of magnitude performance improvement over more traditional communication libraries. This paper discusses the experience we gained while implementing active messages on the Meiko CS-2, and discusses implementations for similar architectures. During our work we have identified that architectures which only support efficient remote write operations (or DMA transfers as in the case of the CS-2) make it difficult to transfer both data and control as required by active messages. Traditional network interfaces avoid this problem because they have a single point of entry which essentially acts as a queue. To efficiently support active messages on modern network communication co-processors, hardware primitives are required which support this queue behavior. We overcame this problem by producing specialized code which runs on the communications co-processor and supports ...
386|Virtual-memorymapped network interfaces|In todays multicomputers, software overhead dominates the message-passing latency cost. We designed two multicomputer network interfaces that signif~cantiy reduce this overhead. Both support vMual-memory-mapped communication, allowing user processes to communicate without expensive buffer management and without making system calls across the protection boundary separating user processes from the operating system kerneL Here we compare the two interfaces and discuss the performance trade-offs between them.
387|Sampling Large Databases for Association Rules|Discovery of association rules is an important database mining problem. Current algorithms for nding association rules require several passes over the analyzed database, and obviously the role of I/O overhead is very signi cant for very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce the database activity considerably. Theidea is to pick a random sample, to ndusingthis sample all association rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then to verify the results with the restofthe database. The algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, probabilistic, and inthose rare cases where our sampling method does not produce all association rules, the missing rules can be found inasecond pass. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms can nd association rules very e ciently in only onedatabase pass. 1
389|Discovery of Multiple-Level Association Rules from Large Databases|Previous studies on mining association rules find rules at single concept level, however, mining association rules at multiple concept levels may lead to the discovery of more specific and concrete knowledge from data. In this study, a top-down progressive deepening method is developed for mining multiplelevel association rules from large transaction databases by extension of some existing association rule mining techniques. A group of variant algorithms are proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results, with the relative performance tested on different kinds of data. Relaxation of the rule conditions for finding &#034;level-crossing&#034; association rules is also discussed in the paper.
390|An effective hash-based algorithm for mining association rules|In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we propose an effective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm. 1
391|The Power of Sampling in Knowledge Discovery|We consider the problem of approximately verifying the truth of sentences of tuple relational calculus in a given relation M by considering only a random sample of M . We define two different measures for the error of a universal sentence in a relation. For a set of n universal sentences each with at most k universal quantifiers, we give upper and lower bounds for the sample sizes required for having a high probability that all the sentences with error at least &#034; can be detected as false by considering the sample. The sample sizes are O((ln n)=&#034;) or O((jM j 1\Gamma1=k ln n)=&#034;), depending on the error measure used. We also consider universal-existential sentences.

392|On an algorithm for finding all interesting sentences (Extended Abstract)  (1996) |Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), also called data mining, has recently received wide attention from practitioners and researchers. One of the basic problems in KDD is the following: given a data set r, a class L of sentences defining subgroups or properties of r, and an interestingness predicate, find all sentences of L deemed interesting by the interestingness predicate. In this paper we analyze a simple and well-known levelwise algorithm for finding all such descriptions. We give bounds for the number of database accesses that the algorithm makes. We also consider the verification problem of a KDD process: given r and a set of sentences T ` L, determine whether T is exactly the set of interesting statements about r. We show strong connections between the verification problem and the hypergraph transversal problem. The verification problem arises in a natural way when using sampling to speed up the pattern discovery step in KDD.
393|Pastry: Scalable, distributed object location and routing for large-scale peer-to-peer systems|This paper presents the design and evaluation of Pastry, a scalable, distributed object location and routing scheme for wide-area peer-to-peer applications. Pastry provides application-level routing and object location in a potentially very large overlay network of nodes connected via the Internet. It can be used to support a wide range of peer-to-peer applications like global data storage, global data sharing, and naming. An insert operation in Pastry stores an object at a user-defined number of diverse nodes within the Pastry network. A lookup operation reliably retrieves a copy of the requested object if one exists. Moreover, a lookup is usually routed to the node nearest the client issuing the lookup (by some measure of proximity), among the nodes storing the requested object. Pastry is completely decentralized, scalable, and self-configuring; it automatically adapts to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation on a simulated network of 100,000 nodes confirm Pastry&#039;s scalability, its ability to self-configure and adapt to node failures, and its good network locality properties.
394|Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System|We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network application  that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data  while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet operates  as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage  space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most  likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location  index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent  manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and  deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover  the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network,  and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for  the actual physical contents of her own node.
395|A Scalable Location Service for Geographic Ad Hoc Routing |GLS is a new distributed location service which tracks mobile node locations. GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows the construction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger number of nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized and runs on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixed infrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set of other nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A node sends its position updates to its location servers without knowing their actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of node identifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for a mobile nodes location also use the predefined identifier ordering and spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node. Experiments using the ns simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes show that the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly with the size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failures well: each failure has only a limited effect and query performance degrades gracefully as nodes fail and restart. The query performance of GLS is also relatively insensitive to node speeds. Simple geographic forwarding combined with GLS compares favorably with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): in larger networks (over 200 nodes) our approach delivers more packets, but consumes fewer network resources.
396|Overcast: Reliable Multicasting with an Overlay Network|Overcast is an application-level multicasting system that can be incrementally deployed using today&#039;s Internet infrastructure. These properties stem from Overcast&#039;s implementation as an overlay network. An overlay network consists of a collection of nodes placed at strategic locations in an existing network fabric. These nodes implement a network abstraction on top of the network provided by the underlying substrate network. Overcast  provides
397|The design and implementation of an intentional naming system|This paper presents the design and implementation of the Intentional Naming System (INS), a resource discovery and service location system for dynamic and mobile networks of devices and computers. Such environments require a naming system that is (i) expressive, to describe and make requests based on specific properties of services, (ii) responsive, to track changes due to mobility and performance, (iii) robust, to handle failures, and (iv) easily configurable. INS uses a simple language based on attributes and values for its names. Applications use the language to describe what they are looking for (i.e., their intent), not where to find things (i.e., not hostnames). INS implements a late binding mechanism that integrates name resolution and message routing, enabling clients to continue communicating with end-nodes even if the name-to-address mappings change while a session is in progress. INS resolvers self-configure to form an application-level overlay network, which they use to discover new services, perform late binding, and maintain weak consistency of names using soft-state name exchanges and updates. We analyze the performance of the INS algorithms and protocols, present measurements of a Java-based implementation, and describe three applications we have implemented that demonstrate the feasibility and utility of INS.
398|Feasibility of a Serverless Distributed File System Deployed on an Existing Set of Desktop PCs|We consider an architecture for a serverless distributed file system that does not assume mutual trust among the client computers. The system provides security, availability, and reliability by distributing multiple encrypted replicas of each file among the client machines. To assess the feasibility of deploying this system on an existing desktop infrastructure, we measure and analyze a large set of client machines in a commercial environment. In particular, we measure and report results on disk usage and content; file activity; and machine uptimes, lifetimes, and loads. We conclude that the measured desklop infrastructure would passably support our proposed system, providing availability on the order of one unfilled file request per user per thousand days. Keywords Serverless distributed file system architecture, personal computer
399|Designing a Global Name Service|A name service maps a name of an individual, organization or facility into a set of labeled properties, each of which is a string. It is the basis for resource location, mail addressing, and authentication in a distributed computing system. The global name service described here is meant to do this for billions of names distributed throughout the world. It addresses the problems of high availability, large size, continuing evolution, fault isolation and lack of global trust. The non-deterministic behavior of the service is specified rather precisely to allow a wide range of client and server implementations.  Introduction  There are already enough names. One must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop averts trouble.  Tao Te Ching The name service I am describing in this talk is intended to be the basis for resource location, mail addressing, and authentication in a distributed computing system. The system I have in mind is a large one, large enough to encompass all the computers in t...
400|Piconet: Embedded Mobile Networking|Piconet is a general-purpose, low-power ad hoc radio network. It provides a base level of connectivity to even the simplest of sensing and  computing objects. It is our intention that a full range of portable and embedded devices may make use of this connectivity. This article outlines  the Piconet system, under development at the Olivetti and Oracle Research Laboratory (ORL). The authors discuss the motivation for providing  this low-level &#034;embedded networking,&#034; and describe their experiences of building such a system. The article concludes with a commentary on  some of the implications that power saving, and other considerations central to Piconet, have on the design of the system.
401|Decentralizing a Global Naming Service for Improved Performance and Fault Tolerance|Naming is an important aspect of distributed system design. A naming system allows users and programs to assign character-string names to objects and subsequently use the names to refer to those objects. With the interconnection of clusters of computers by wide-area networks and internetworks, the domain over which naming systems must function is growing to encompass the entire world. In this paper, we address the problem of a global naming system, proposing a three-level naming architecture that consists of global, administrational, and managerial naming mechanisms, each optimized to meet the performance, reliability, and security requirements at its own level. We focus in particular on a decentralized approach to the lower levels, in which naming is handled directly by the managers of the named objects. Client name caching and multicast are exploited to implement name mapping with almost optimum performance and fault tolerance. We also show how the naming system can be made...

403|Seamlessly Selecting the Best Copy from Internet-Wide Replicated Web Servers|. The explosion of the web has led to a situation where a majority of the traffic on the Internet is web related. Today, practically all of the popular web sites are served from single locations. This necessitates frequent long distance network transfers of data (potentially repeatedly) which results in a high response time for users, and is wasteful of the available network bandwidth. Moreover, it commonly creates a single point of failure between the web site and its Internet provider. This paper presents a new approach to web replication, where each of the replicas resides in a different part of the network, and the browser is automatically and  transparently directed to the &#034;best&#034; server. Implementing this architecture for popular web sites will result in a better response-time and a higher availability of these sites. Equally important, this architecture will potentially cut down a significant fraction of the traffic on the Internet, freeing bandwidth for other uses. 1. Introducti...
404|A Replicated Architecture for the Domain Name System|We propose a new design for the Domain Name System (DNS) that takes advantage of recent advances in disk storage and multicast distribution technology. In essence, our design consists of geographically distributed servers, called replicated servers, each of which having a complete and up-to-date copy of the entire DNS database. To keep the replicated servers up-to-date, they distribute new resource records over a satellite channel or over terrestrial multicast. The design allows Web sites to dynamically wander and replicate themselves without having to change their URLs. The design can also significantly improve the Web surfing experience since it significantly reduces the DNS lookup delay.
405|Distributed packet switching for local computer networks|Abstract: Ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations. The packet transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. An Ethernet&#039;s shared communication facility, its Ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central control. Coordination of access to the Ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. Switching of packets to their destinations on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition. Design principles and implementation are described based on experience.with an operating Ethernet of1 00 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable. A model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error-controlled communication are included for completeness.
406|Implementing atomic actions on decentralized data|Synchronization of accesses to shared data and recovering the state of such data in the case of failures are really two aspects of the same problem--implementing atomic actions on a related set of data items. In this paper a mechanism that solves both problems simultaneously in a way that is compatible with requirements of decentralized systems is described. In particular, the correct construction and execution of a new atomic action can be accomplished without knowledge of all other atomic actions in the system that might execute concurrently. Further, the mechanisms degrade gracefully if parts of the system fail: only those atomic actions that require resources in failed parts of the system are prevented from executing, and there is no single coordinator that can fail and bring down the whole system.

Distributed termination|Drawing on testimony presented at hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and Safety of the house of Representatives conducted between February 28 and June 12, 1984, this staff report addresses the general topic of video display terminals (VDTs) and possible health hazards in the workplace. An introduction presents the history of the development of vrTs and summarizes current scientific knowledge about VDT, with emphasis on the fear of radiation exposure. Figures are used to illustrate both how a VDT works and how VDT radiation is measured. Reproductive hazards from VDTs are discussed, including results of three surveys (Newspaper Guild-Mount Sinai, 9 to 5, and Canadian Scientists) and a proposed study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Remarks are also included from (1) witnesses from various labor organizations--9 to 5, the Service Employees International
409|GPFS: A Shared-Disk File System for Large Computing Clusters|GPFS is IBM&#039;s parallel, shared-disk file system for cluster computers, available on the RS/6000 SP parallel supercomputer and on Linux clusters. GPFS is used on many of the largest supercomputers in the world. GPFS was built on many of the ideas that were developed in the academic community over the last several years, particularly distributed locking and recovery technology. To date it has been a matter of conjecture how well these ideas scale. We have had the opportunity to test those limits in the context of a product that runs on the largest systems in existence. While in many cases existing ideas scaled well, new approaches were necessary in many key areas. This paper describes GPFS, and discusses how distributed locking and recovery techniques were extended to scale to large clusters.
410|Petal: Distributed Virtual Disks|The ideal storage system is globally accessible, always available, provides unlimited performance and capacity for a large number of clients, and requires no management. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of Petal, a system that attempts to approximate this ideal in practice through a novel combination of features. Petal consists of a collection of networkconnected servers that cooperatively manage a pool of physical disks. To a Petal client, this collection appears as a highly available block-level storage system that provides large abstract containers called virtual disks. A virtual disk is globally accessible to all Petal clients on the network. A client can create a virtual disk on demand to tap the entire capacity and performance of the underlying physical resources. Furthermore, additional resources, such as servers and disks, can be automatically incorporated into Petal. We have an initial Petal prototype consisting of four 225 MHz DEC 3000/700 work...
411| Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System |The ideal distributed file system would provide all its users with coherent, shared access to the same set of files,yet would be arbitrarily scalable to provide more storage space and higher performance to a growing user community. It would be highly available in spite of component failures. It would require minimal human administration, and administration would not become more complex as more components were added. Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet was relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure. The lower layer is Petal (described in an earlier paper), a distributed storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks. In the upper layer, multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to ensure coherence. Frangipaniis meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under a common administration and can communicate securely. Thus the machines trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is practical. Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to untrusted machines using ordinary network file access protocols. We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas running DIGITAL Unix 4.0. Initial measurements indicate that Frangipani has excellent single-server performance and scales well as servers are added.  
412|Recovery and coherency-control protocols for fast intersystem page transfer and fine-granularity locking in a shared disks transaction environment|llbstract This paper proposes schemes for fast page transfer between transaction system Instances In a shared disks (SD) environment where all the sharing Instances can read and modify the same data Fast page transfer improves transaction response time and concur-rency because one or more disk I/OS are avoided while transferring a page from a system which modified it to another system which needs it. The proposed methods work with the steal and no-force buffer management policies, and fine-granularity (e.g., record) locking For each of the page-transfer schemes, we present both recovery and coherency-control protocols Updates can be made to a page by several systems before the page is written to disk. Many subtleties Involved in correctly recovering such a page in the face of single system or complex-wide failures are also discussed. Assuming that each system maintains its own log, some methods require a merged log for restart recovery while others dont Our proposals should also apply to dlstrihuted. recoverable file systems and distributed virtual memory in the SD environment, and to the currently oopular client-server object-oriented DBMS environments where the clients cache data. 1.
413|Tiger Shark - a scalable file system for multimedia|Tiger Shark is a scalable, parallel file system designed to support interactive multimedia applications, particularly large-scale ones such as interactive television (ITV). Tiger Shark runs under the IBM AIX operating system, on machines ranging from RS/6000 desktop workstations to the SP2 parallel supercomputer. In addition to supporting continuous-time data, Tiger Shark provides scalability, high availability, and on-line system management, all of which are crucial in large-scale video servers. These latter features also enable Tiger Shark to support non-multimedia applications such as scientific computing, data mining, digital library, and scalable network file servers. Tiger Shark has been employed in a number of customer ITV trials. Based on experience obtained from these trials, Tiger Shark has recently been released in several IBM video server products. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of Tiger Shark, discusses the experience gained from trials, and compa...
414|Tinydb: An acquisitional query processing system for sensor networks|We discuss the design of an acquisitional query processor for data collection in sensor networks. Acquisitional issues are those that pertain to where, when, and how often data is physically acquired (sampled) and delivered to query processing operators. By focusing on the locations and costs of acquiring data, we are able to significantly reduce power consumption over traditional passive systems that assume the a priori existence of data. We discuss simple extensions to SQL for controlling data acquisition, and show how acquisitional issues influence query optimization, dissemination, and execution. We evaluate these issues in the context of TinyDB, a distributed query processor for smart sensor devices, and show how acquisitional techniques can provide significant reductions in power consumption on our sensor devices.

415|Directed Diffusion: A scalable and robust communication paradigm for sensor networks|Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will enable small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate to perform distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper, we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such coordination. Directed diffusion is data-centric in that all communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.
416|System architecture directions for networked sensors|Technological progress in integrated, low-power, CMOS communication devices and sensors makes a rich design space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply embedded in the physical world or spread throughout our environment. The missing elements are an overall system architecture and a methodology for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key requirements, develop a small device that is representative of the class, design a tiny event-driven operating system, and show that it provides support for efficient modularity and concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis lays a groundwork for future architectural advances. 
417|ANALYSIS OF WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS FOR HABITAT MONITORING|  We provide an in-depth study of applying wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to real-world habitat monitoring. A set of system design requirements were developed that cover the hardware design of the nodes, the sensor network software, protective enclosures, and system architecture to meet the requirements of biologists. In the summer of 2002, 43 nodes were deployed on a small island off the coast of Maine streaming useful live data onto the web. Although researchers anticipate some challenges arising in real-world deployments of WSNs, many problems can only be discovered through experience. We present a set of experiences from a four month long deployment on a remote island. We analyze the environmental and node health data to evaluate system performance. The close integration of WSNs with their environment provides environmental data at densities previously impossible. We show that the sensor data is also useful for predicting system operation and network failures. Based on over one million 2 Polastre et. al. data readings, we analyze the node and network design and develop network reliability profiles and failure models.
419|The Cricket Location-Support System|This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Cricket, a location-support system for in-building, mobile, locationdependent applications. It allows applications running on mobile and static nodes to learn their physical location by using listeners that hear and analyze information from beacons spread throughout the building. Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost. Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or control and there is no explicit coordination between beacons; it provides information to devices regardless of their type of network connectivity; and each Cricket device is made from off-the-shelf components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy. Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent applications such as in-building active maps and device control can be developed with little effort or manual configuration.  1 
420|The nesC language: A holistic approach to networked embedded systems|We present nesC, a programming language for networked embedded systems that represent a new design space for application developers. An example of a networked embedded system is a sensor network, which consists of (potentially) thousands of tiny, lowpower motes,  each of which execute concurrent, reactive programs that must operate with severe memory and power constraints. nesCs contribution is to support the special needs of this domain by exposing a programming model that incorporates event-driven execution, a flexible concurrency model, and component-oriented application design. Restrictions on the programming model allow the nesC compiler to perform whole-program analyses, including data-race detection (which improves reliability) and aggressive function inlining (which reduces resource consumption). nesC has been used to implement TinyOS, a small operating system for sensor networks, as well as several significant sensor applications. nesC and TinyOS have been adopted by a large number of sensor network research groups, and our experience and evaluation of the language shows that it is effective at supporting the complex, concurrent programming style demanded by this new class of deeply networked systems.
421|NiagaraCQ: A Scalable Continuous Query System for Internet Databases|Continuous queries are persistent queries that allow users to receive new results when they become available. While continuous query systems can transform a passive web into an active environment, they need to be able to support millions of queries due to the scale of the Internet. No existing systems have achieved this level of scalability. NiagaraCQ addresses this problem by grouping continuous queries based on the observation that many web queries share similar structures. Grouped queries can share the common computation, tend to fit in memory and can reduce the I/O cost significantly. Furthermore, grouping on selection predicates can eliminate a large number of unnecessary query invocations. Our grouping technique is distinguished from previous group optimization approaches in the following ways. First, we use an incremental group optimization strategy with dynamic re-grouping. New queries are added to existing query groups, without having to regroup already installed queries. Second, we use a query-split scheme that requires minimal changes to a general-purpose query engine. Third, NiagaraCQ groups both change-based and timer-based queries in a uniform way. To insure that NiagaraCQ is scalable, we have also employed other techniques including incremental evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes, and memory caching. This paper presents the design of NiagaraCQ system and gives some experimental results on the systems performance and scalability. 1.
422|Timing-Sync Protocol for Sensor Networks|Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have emerged as an interesting and important research area in the last few years. The applications envisioned for such networks require collaborative execution of a distributed task amongst a large set of sensor nodes. This is realized by exchanging messages that are timestamped using the local clocks on the nodes. Therefore, time synchronization becomes an indispensable piece of infrastructure in such systems. For years, protocols such as NTP have kept the clocks of networked systems in perfect synchrony. However, this new class of networks has a large density of nodes and very limited energy resource at every node; this leads to scalability requirements while limiting the resources that can be used to achieve them. A new approach to time synchronization is needed for sensor networks.
423|TelegraphCQ: Continuous Dataflow Processing for an Uncertan World|Increasingly pervasive networks are leading towards a world where data is constantly in motion. In such a world, conventional techniques for query processing, which were developed under the assumption of a far more static and predictable computational environment, will not be sufficient. Instead, query processors based on adaptive dataflow will be necessary. The Telegraph project has developed a suite of novel technologies for continuously adaptive query processing. The next generation Telegraph system, called TelegraphCQ, is focused on meeting the challenges that arise in handling large streams of continuous queries over high-volume, highly-variable data streams. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and its underlying technology, and report on our ongoing implementation effort, which leverages the PostgreSQL open source code base. We also discuss open issues and our research agenda.
424|The Cougar Approach to In-Network Query Processing in Sensor Networks|The widespread distribution and availability of smallscale sensors, actuators, and embedded processors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.
425|A Transmission Control Scheme for Media Access in Sensor Networks|We study the problem of media access control in the novel regime of sensor networks, where unique application behavior and tight constraints in computation power, storage, energy resources, and radio technology have shaped this design space to be very different from that found in traditional mobile computing regime. Media access control in sensor networks must not only be energy efficient but should also allow fair bandwidth allocation to the infrastructure for all nodes in a multihop network. We propose an adaptive rate control mechanism aiming to support these two goals and find that such a scheme is most effective in achieving our fairness goal while being energy effcient for both low and high duty cycle of network traffic.
426|Routing indices for peer-to-peer systems|Finding information in a peer-to-peer system currently requires either a costly and vulnerable central index, or ooding the network with queries. In this paper we introduce the concept of Routing Indices (RIs), which allow nodes to forward queries to neighbors that are more likely to have answers. If a node cannot answer a query, it forwards the query to a subset of its neighbors, based on its local RI, rather than by selecting neighbors at random or by ooding the network by forwarding the query to all neighbors. We present three RI schemes: the compound, the hop-count, and the exponential routing indices. We evaluate their performance via simulations, and nd that RIs can improve performance by one or two orders of magnitude vs. a ooding-based system, and by up to 100 % vs. a random forwarding system. We also discuss the tradeo s between the di erent RIschemes and highlight the e ects of key design variables on system performance.
427|Eddies: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing|In large federated and shared-nothing databases, resources can exhibit widely fluctuating characteristics. Assumptions made at the time a query is submitted will rarely hold throughout the duration of query processing. As a result, traditional static query optimization and execution techniques are ineffective in these environments.  In this paper we introduce a query processing mechanism called an eddy, which continuously reorders operators in a query plan as it runs. We characterize the moments of symmetry  during which pipelined joins can be easily reordered, and the synchronization barriers that require inputs from different sources to be coordinated. By combining eddies with appropriate join algorithms, we merge the optimization and execution phases of query processing, allowing each tuple to have a flexible ordering of the query operators. This flexibility is controlled by a combination of fluid dynamics and a simple learning algorithm. Our initial implementation demonstrates prom...
429|An Adaptive Query Execution System for Data Integration|Query processing in data integration occurs over networkbound, autonomous data sources. This requires extensions to traditional optimization and execution techniques for three reasons: there is an absence of quality statistics about the data, data transfer rates are unpredictable and bursty, and slow or unavailable data sources can often be replaced by overlapping or mirrored sources. This paper presents the  Tukwila data integration system, designed to support adaptivity at its core using a two-pronged approach. Interleaved planning and execution with partial optimization allows Tukwila  to quickly recover from decisions based on inaccurate estimates. During execution, Tukwila uses adaptive query operators such as the double pipelined hash join, which produces answers quickly, and the dynamic collector, which robustly and efficiently computes unions across overlapping data sources. We demonstrate that the Tukwila architecture extends previous innovations in adaptive execution (such as...
430|Approximate Query Processing Using Wavelets|Abstract. Approximate query processing has emerged as a cost-effective approach for dealing with the huge data volumes and stringent response-time requirements of todays decision support systems (DSS). Most work in this area, however, has so far been limited in its query processing scope, typically focusing on specific forms of aggregate queries. Furthermore, conventional approaches based on sampling or histograms appear to be inherently limited when it comes to approximating the results of complex queries over high-dimensional DSS data sets. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-dimensional wavelets as an effective tool for general-purpose approximate query processing in modern, high-dimensional applications. Our approach is based on building wavelet-coefficient synopses of the data and using these synopses to provide approximate answers to queries. We develop novel query processing
431|Optimization of nonrecursive queries|State-of-the-art optimization approaches for relational database systems, e.g., those used in systems such as OBE, SQL/DS, and commercial INGRES. when used for queries in non-traditional database applications, suffer from two problems. First, the time complexity of their optimization algorithms, being combinatoric, is exponential in the number of relations to be joined in the query. Their cost is therefore prohibitive in situa-tions such as deductive databases and logic oriented languages for knowledge bases, where hundreds of joins may be required. The second problem with the traditional approaches is that, al-beit effective in their specific domain, it is not clear whether they can be generalized to different scenarios (e.g. parallel evalua-tion) since they lack a formal model to define the assumptions and critical factors on which their valiclity depends. This paper
432|Extensible/Rule Based Query Rewrite Optimization in Starburst|This paper describes the Query Rewrite facility of the Starburst extensible database system, a novel phase of query optimization. We present a suite of rewrite rules used in Starburst to transform queries into equivalent queries for faster execution, and also describe the production rule engine which is used by Starburst to choose and execute these rules. Examples are provided demonstrating that these Query Rewrite transformations lead to query execution time improvements of orders of magnitude, suggesting that Query Rewrite in general --- and these rewrite rules in particular --- are an essential step in query optimization for modern database systems.  1 Introduction  In traditional database systems, query optimization typically consists of a single phase of processing in which access methods, join orders and join methods are chosen to provide an efficient plan for executing a user&#039;s declarative query. We refer to this phase as plan optimization. In this paper we present a distinct ph...
433|Query Processing, Approximation, and Resource Management In a Data Stream Management System|This paper describes our ongoing work developing the Stanford Stream Data Manager (STREAM), a system for executing continuous queries over multiple continuous data streams. The STREAM system supports a declarative query language, and it copes with high data rates and query workloads by providing approximate answers when resources are limited. This paper describes specific contributions made so far and enumerates our next steps in developing a general-purpose Data Stream Management System.
434|Querying in highly mobile distributed environments|New challenges to the database field brought about by the rapidly growing area of wireless personal communication are presented. Preliminary solutions to two of the major problems, control of update volume and integration of query processing and data acquisition, are discussed along with the simulation results. 1
435|Adaptive Query Processing: Technology in Evolution|As query engines are scaled and federated, they must cope with highly unpredictable and changeable environments. In the Telegraph project, we are attempting to architect and implement a continuously adaptive query engine suitable for global-area systems, massive parallelism, and sensor networks. To set the stage for our research, we present a survey of prior work on adaptive query processing, focusing on three characterizations of adaptivity: the frequency of adaptivity, the effects of adaptivity, and the extent of adaptivity. Given this survey, we sketch directions for research in the Telegraph project.  
436|Database System Issues in Nomadic Computing|Mobile computers and wireless networks are emerging technologies that will soon be available to a  wide variety of computer users. Unlike earlier generations of laptop computers, the new generation  of mobile computers can be an integrated part of a distributed computing environment, one in  which users change physical location frequently. The result is a new computing paradigm, nomadic  computing. This paradigm will affect the design of much of our current systems software, including  that of database systems.  This paper discusses in some detail the impact of nomadic computing on a number of traditional  database system concepts. In particular, we point out how the reliance on short-lived batteries  changes the cost assumptions underlying query processing. In these systems, power consumption  competes with resource utilization in the definition of cost metrics. We also discuss how the likelihood  of temporary disconnection forces consideration of alternative transaction processing pr...
437|Optimization techniques for queries with expensive methods|Object-Relational database management systems allow knowledgeable users to de ne new data types, as well as new methods (operators) for the types. This exibility produces an attendant complexity, which must be handled in new ways for an Object-Relational database management system to be e cient. In this paper we study techniques for optimizing queries that contain time-consuming methods. The focus of traditional query optimizers has been on the choice of join methods and orders; selections have been handled by \pushdown &#034; rules. These rules apply selections in an arbitrary order before as many joins as possible, using the assumption that selection takes no time. However, users of Object-Relational systems can embed complex methods in selections. Thus selections may take signi cant amounts of time, and the query optimization model must be enhanced. In this paper, we carefully de ne a query cost framework that incorporates both selectivity and cost estimates for selections. We develop an algorithm called Predicate Migration, and prove that it produces optimal plans for queries with expensive methods. We then describe our implementation of Predicate Migration in the commercial Object-Relational database management system Illustra, and discuss practical issues that a ect our earlier assumptions. We compare Predicate Migration to a variety of simpler optimization techniques, and demonstrate that Predicate Migration is the best general solution to date. The alternative techniques we presentmaybe useful for constrained workloads.
438|Cost-based Query Scrambling for Initial Delays|Remote data access from disparate sources across a wide-area network such as the Internet is problematic due to the unpredictable nature of the communications medium and the lack of knowledge about the load and potential delays at remote sites. Traditional, static, query processing approaches break down in this environment because they are unable to adapt in response to unexpected delays. Query scrambling has been proposed to address this problem. Scrambling modifies query execution plans on-the-fly when delays are encountered during runtime. In its original formulation, scrambling was based on simple heuristics, which although providing good performance in many cases, were also shown to be susceptible to problems resulting from bad scrambling decisions. In this paper we address these shortcomings by investigating ways to exploit query optimization technology to aid in making intelligent scrambling choices. We propose three different approaches to using query optimization for scramblin...
439|Adaptive Parallel Aggregation Algorithms|Aggregation and duplicate removal are common in SQL queries. However, in the parallel query processing literature, aggregate processing has received surprisingly little attention; furthermore, for each of the traditional parallel aggregation algorithms, there is a range of grouping selectivities where the algorithm performs poorly. In this work, we propose new algorithms that dynamically adapt, at query evaluation time, in response to observed grouping selectivities. Performance analysis via analytical modeling and an implementation on a workstation-cluster shows that the proposed algorithms are able to perform well for all grouping selectivities. Finally, we study the effect of data skew and show that for certain data sets the proposed algorithms can even outperform the best of traditional approaches. 1 Introduction  SQL queries are replete with aggregate and duplicate elimination operations.

441|Bluetooth and Sensor Networks: A Reality Check|The current generation of sensor nodes rely on commodity components. The choice of the radio is particularly important as it impacts not only energy consumption but also software design (e.g., network self-assembly, multihop routing and in-network processing). Bluetooth is one of the most popular commodity radios for wireless devices. As a representative of the frequency hopping spread spectrum radios, it is a natural alternative to broadcast radios in the context of sensor networks. The question is whether Bluetooth can be a viable alternative in practice. In this paper, we report our experience using Bluetooth for the sensor network regime. We describe our tiny Bluetooth stack that allows TinyOS applications to run on Bluetooth-based sensor nodes, we present a multihop network assembly procedure that leverages Bluetooth&#039;s device discovery protocol, and we discuss how Bluetooth favorably impacts in-network query processing. Our results show that despite obvious limitations the Bluetooth sensor nodes we studied exhibit interesting properties, such as a good energy per bit sent ratio. This reality check underlies the limitations and some promises of Bluetooth for the sensor network regime.
442|Aggregation and Relevance in Deductive Databases|In this paper we present a technique to optimize queries on deductive databases that use aggregate operations such as min, max, and largest Ic values.  Our approach is based on an extended notion of relevance of facts to queries that takes aggregate operations into account. The approach has two parts: a rewriting part that labels predica.tes with ag-gregate selections,  and an evaluat,ion part. t.hat, makes use of aggregate selections  to detect that facts are irrelevant and discards them. The rewriting complements standard rewrit-ing algorithms like Magic sets, and the evaluation essentially refines Semi-Naive evaluation. 1
443|Query Optimization In Compressed Database Systems|Over the lastd ecad es, improvements in CPU speed have outpaced improvements in main memory and d isk access rates by ord ers of magnitud , enabling the use ofd ata compression techniques to improve the performance ofd atabase systems. Previous work d scribes the benefits of compression for numerical attributes, whered8 a is stored in compressed  format ond isk. Despite the abund3&amp; e of stringvalued  attributes in relational schemas there is little work on compression for string attributes in ad atabase context. Moreover, none of the previous work suitablyad2 esses the role of the query optimizer: During query execution, dD a is either eagerly d compressed when it is read into main memory, or dD a lazily stays compressed in main memory and is d compressed ond emand only. In this paper, we present an e#ective approach for dD abase compression based on lightweight, attribute-level compression techniques. We propose a Hierarchical ictionary Encod  ing strategy that intelligently selects the most e#ective compression method for string-valued attributes. We show that eager and lazy d compression strategies prod1 e suboptimal plans for queries involving compressed string attributes. We then formalize the problem of compressionaware query optimizationand propose one provably optimal  and two fast heuristic algorithms for selecting a query plan for relational schemas with compressed attributes; our algorithms can easily be integrated into existing cost-based query optimizers. Experiments using TPC-Hd atad emonstrate the impact of our string compression method s and show the importance of compression-aware query optimization. Our approach results in up to an or d r speed up over existing approaches.  1. 
444|The Design and Implementation of the Ariel Active Database Rule System|This paper describes the design and implementation of the Ariel DBMS and it&#039;s tightlycoupled forward-chaining rule system. The query language of Ariel is a subset of POSTQUEL, extended with a new production-rule sublanguage. Ariel supports traditional relational database query and update operations efficiently, using a System Rlike query processing strategy. In addition, the Ariel rule system is tightly coupled with query and update processing. Ariel rules can have conditions based on a mix of patterns, events, and transitions. For testing rule conditions, Ariel makes use of a discrimination network composed of a special data structure for testing single-relation selection conditions efficiently, and a modified version of the TREAT algorithm, called A-TREAT, for testing join conditions. The key modification to TREAT (which could also be used in the Rete algorithm) is the use of virtual ff-memory nodes which save storage since they contain only the predicate associated with the memory n...
445|DOMINO: Databases fOr MovINg Objects tracking|Consider a database that represents information about moving objects and their location. For example, for a database representing the location of taxi-cabs a typical query may be: retrieve the free cabs that are currently within 1 mile of 33 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago (to pick-up a customer); or for a trucking company database a typical query may be: retrieve the trucks that are currently within 1 mile of truck ABT312 (which needs assistance); or for a database representing the current location of objects in a battlefield a typical query may be: retrieve the friendly helicopters that are in a given region, or, retrieve the friendly helicopters that are expected to enter the region within the next 10 minutes. The queries may originate from the moving objects, or from stationary users. We will refer to applications with the above characteristics as moving-objects-database (MOD) applications, and to queries as the ones mentioned above as MOD queries.
446|From ethnography to design in a vineyard, in|This paper summarizes the process from ethnographic study of a vineyard to concept development and interaction design for a ubiquitous computing solution. It provides examples of vineyard interfaces and the lessons learned that could be generally applied to the interaction design of ubiquitous systems. These are: design for multiple perspectives on data, design for multiple access points, and design for varying levels of attention.
447|Query Optimization in Mobile Environments|We consider the issue of optimizing queries for a distributed processing in mobile environment. An interesting characteristic of mobile machines is that they depend on battery as a source of energy which may not be substantial enough. Hence, the appropriate optimization criterion in a mobile environment considers both resource utilization and energy consumption at the mobile client. In this scenario, the optimal plan for a query depends on the residual battery level of the mobile client and the load at the server. We approach this problem by compiling a query into a sequence of candidate plans, such that for any state of the client-server system, the optimal plan is one of the candidate plans. A general solution is proposed by adapting the partial order dynamic programming search algorithm [17, 18] (p.o dp) such that the coverset of the query is the set of candidate plans. We propose two novel algorithms, namely, the linear combinations algorithm and the linearset algorithm (referred t...
448|Online Dynamic Reordering|We present a mechanism for providing dynamic user control during long running, data-intensive operations. Users  can see partial results and dynamically direct the processing to suit their interests, thereby enhancing the interactivity  in several contexts such as online aggregation and large-scale spreadsheets.  In this paper, we develop a pipelining, dynamically tunable reorder operator for providing user control. Users  specify preferences for different data items based on prior results, so that data of interest is prioritized for early  processing. The reordering mechanism is efficient and non-blocking, and can be used over arbitrary data streams  from files and indexes, as well as continuous data feeds. We also investigate several policies for the reordering  based on the performance goals of various typical applications. We present performance results for reordering in the  context of an Online Aggregation implementation in Informix, and in the context of sorting and scrolling in...
449|Atomic Broadcast: From Simple Message Diffusion to Byzantine Agreement|In distributed systems subject to random communication delays and component failures, atomic broadcast can be used to implement the abstraction of synchronous replicated storage, a distributed storage that displays the same contents at every correct processor as of any clock time. This paper presents a systematic derivation of a family of atomic broadcast protocols that are tolerant of increasingly general failure classes: omission failures, timing failures, and authentication-detectable Byzantine failures. The protocols work for arbitrary point-to-point network topologies, and can tolerate any number of link and process failures up to network partitioning. After proving their correctness, we also prove two lower bounds that show that the protocols provide in many cases the best possible termination times. Keywords and phrases: Atomic Broadcast, Byzantine Agreement, Computer Network, Correctnesss, Distributed System, Failure Classification, Fault-Tolerance, Lower Bound, Real-Time Syste...
450|Distributed Process Groups in the V Kernel|The V kernel supports an abstraction of processes, with operations for interprocess communication, process management, and memory management. This abstraction is used as a software base for constructing distributed systems. As a distributed kernel, the V kernel makes intermachine bound-aries largely transparent. In this environment of many cooperating processes on different machines, there are many logical groups of processes. Examples include the group of tile servers, a group of processes executing a particular job, and a group of processes executing a distributed parallel computation. In this paper we describe the extension of the V kernel to support process groups. Operations on groups include group interprocess communication, which provides an application-level abstraction of network multicast. Aspects of the implementation and performance, and initial experience with applications are discussed.
451|Maintaining Availability in Partitioned Replicated Databases|In a replicated database, a data item may have copies residing on several sites. A replica control protocol is necessary to ensure that data items with several copies behave as if they consist of a single copy, as far as users can tell. We describe a new replica control protocol that allows the accessing of data in spite of site failures and network partitioning. This protocol provides the database designer with a large degree of flexibility in deciding the degree of data availability, as well as the cost of accessing data.
452|Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis|Abstract. We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacypreserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f =P i g(xi), where xi denotes the ith row of the database and g maps data-base rows to [0, 1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive. 1 Introduction We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacy in statistical data-bases. A statistic is a quantity computed from a sample. Intuitively, if the database is a representative sample of an underlying population, the goal ofa privacy-preserving statistical database is to enable the user to learn properties of the population as a whole while protecting the privacy of the individualcontributors.
453|Security-control methods for statistical databases: a comparative study|This paper considers the problem of providing security to statistical databases against disclosure of confidential information. Security-control methods suggested in the literature are classified into four general approaches: conceptual, query restriction, data perturbation, and output perturbation. Criteria for evaluating the performance of the various security-control methods are identified. Security-control methods that are based on each of the four approaches are discussed, together with their performance with respect to the identified evaluation criteria. A detailed comparative analysis of the most promising methods for protecting dynamic-online statistical databases is also presented. To date no single security-control method prevents both exact and partial disclosures. There are, however, a few perturbation-based methods that prevent exact disclosure and enable the database administrator to exercise statistical disclosure control.  Some of these methods, however introduce bias into query responses or suffer from the O/l query-set-size problem (i.e., partial disclosure is possible in case of null query set or a query set of size 1). We recommend directing future research efforts toward developing new methods that prevent exact disclosure and provide statistical-disclosure control, while at the same time do not suffer from the bias problem and the O/l query-set-size problem. Furthermore, efforts directed toward developing a bias-correction mechanism and solving the general problem of small query-set-size would help salvage a few of the current perturbation-based methods.
454|Practical privacy: the sulq framework|We consider a statistical database in which a trusted administrator introduces noise to the query responses with the goal of maintaining privacy of individual database entries. In such a database, a query consists of a pair (S, f) where S is a set of rows in the database and f is a function mapping database rows to {0, 1}. The true answer is P i?S f(di), and a noisy version is released as the response to the query. Results of Dinur, Dwork, and Nissim show that a strong form of privacy can be maintained using a surprisingly small amount of noise  much less than the sampling error  provided the total number of queries is sublinear in the number of database rows. We call this query and (slightly) noisy reply the SuLQ (Sub-Linear Queries) primitive. The assumption of sublinearity becomes reasonable as databases grow increasingly large. We extend this work in two ways. First, we modify the privacy analysis to real-valued functions f and arbitrary row types, as a consequence greatly improving the bounds on noise required for privacy. Second, we examine the computational power of the SuLQ primitive. We show that it is very powerful indeed, in that slightly noisy versions of the following computations can be carried out with very few invocations of the primitive: principal component analysis, k means clustering, the Perceptron Algorithm, the ID3 algorithm, and (apparently!) all algorithms that operate in the in the statistical query learning model [11].
455|Toward privacy in public databases|  We initiate a theoretical study of the census problem. Informally, in a census individual respondents give private information to a trusted party (the census bureau), who publishes a sanitized version of the data. There are two fundamentally conflicting requirements: privacy for the respondents and utility of the sanitized data. Unlike in the study of secure function evaluation, in which privacy is preserved to the extent possible given a specific functionality goal, in the census problem privacy is paramount; intuitively, things that cannot be learned safely  should not be learned at all. An important contribution of this work is a definition of privacy (and privacy compromise) for statistical databases, together with a method for describing and comparing the privacy offered by specific sanitization techniques. We obtain several privacy results using two different sanitization techniques, and then show how to combine them via cross training. We also obtain two utility results involving clustering.  
456|Secure statistical database with random sample queries|A new inference control, called random sample queries, is proposed for safeguarding confidential data in on-line statistical databases. The random sample queries control deals directly with the basic principle of compromise by making it impossible for a questioner to control precisely the formation of query sets. Queries for relative frequencies and averages are computed using random samples drawn from the query sets. The sampling strategy permits the release of accurate and timely statistics and can be implemented at very low cost. Analysis shows the relative error in the statistics decreases as the query set size increases; in contrast, the effort required to compromise increases with the query set size due to large absolute errors. Experiments performed on a simulated database support the analysis.
457|Some 3CNF properties are hard to test|Abstract. For a Boolean formula ? on n variables, the associated property P? is the collection of n-bit strings that satisfy ?. We study the query complexity of tests that distinguish (with high probability) between strings in P? and strings that are far from P? in Hamming distance. We prove that there are 3CNF formulae (with O(n) clauses) such that testing for the associated property requires O(n) queries, even with adaptive tests. This contrasts with 2CNF formulae, whose associated properties are always testable with O (  v n) queries [E. Fischer et al., Monotonicity testing over general poset domains, in Proceedings of the 34th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, New York, 2002, pp. 474483]. Notice that for every negative instance (i.e., an assignment that does not satisfy ?) there are three bit queries that witness this fact. Nevertheless, finding such a short witness requires reading a constant fraction of the input, even when the input is very far from satisfying the formula that is associated with the property. A property is linear if its elements form a linear space. We provide sufficient conditions for linear properties to be hard to test, and in the course of the proof include the following observations which are of independent interest: 1. In the context of testing for linear properties, adaptive two-sided error tests have no more power than nonadaptive one-sided error tests. Moreover, without loss of generality, any test for a linear property is a linear test. A linear test verifies that a portion of the input satisfies a set of linear constraints, which define the property, and rejects if and only if it finds a falsified constraint. A linear test is by definition nonadaptive and, when applied to linear properties, has a one-sided error. 2. Random low density parity check codes (which are known to have linear distance and constant rate) are not locally testable. In fact, testing such a code of length n requires O(n) queries.
458|On Privacy-Preserving Histograms  | We advance the approach initiated by Chawla et al. for sanitizing (census) data so as to preserve the privacy of respondents while simultaneously extracting &amp;quot;useful &amp;quot; statistical information. First, we extend the scope of their techniques to a broad and rich class of distributions, specifically, mixtures of highdeminsional balls, spheres, Gaussians, and other &amp;quot;nice &amp;quot; distributions. Second, we randomize the histogram constructions to preserve spatial characteristics of the data, allowing us to approximate various quantities of interest, such as the cost of the minimum spanning tree on the data, in a privacy-preserving fashion.  
459|Local features and kernels for classification of texture and object categories: a comprehensive study|Recently, methods based on local image features have shown promise for texture and object recognition tasks. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Movers Distance and the ? 2 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter.
460|A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF LOCAL DESCRIPTORS|In this paper we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as for example extracted by the Harris-Affine detector [32]. Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [3], steerable filters [12], PCA-SIFT [19], differential invariants [20], spin images [21], SIFT [26], complex filters [37], moment invariants [43], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor, and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.
461|Video google: A text retrieval approach to object matching in videos|We describe an approach to object and scene retrieval which searches for and localizes all the occurrences of a user outlined object in a video. The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching on two full length feature films. 1.
462|An affine invariant interest point detector|Abstract. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas: 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images.
463|A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification|Recent work in text classification has used two different first-order probabilistic models for classification, both of which make the naive Bayes assumption. Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes---providing on average a 27% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.  
464|Visual categorization with bags of keypoints|Abstract. We present a novel method for generic visual categorization: the problem of identifying the object content of natural images while generalizing across variations inherent to the object class. This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naïve Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information. 1.
465|Pictorial Structures for Object Recognition|In this paper we present a statistical framework for modeling the appearance of objects. Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to model an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We use these models to address the problem of detecting an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, and present efficient algorithms for both these problems. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images.
466|Feature detection with automatic scale selection|The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is proposed for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of ?-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which
467|The earth movers distance as a metric for image retrieval|1 Introduction Multidimensional distributions are often used in computer vision to describe and summarize different features of an image. For example, the one-dimensional distribution of image intensities describes the overall brightness content of a gray-scale image, and a three-dimensional distribution can play a similar role for color images. The texture content of an image can be described by a distribution of local signal energy over frequency. These descriptors can be used in a variety of applications including, for example, image retrieval.
468|Reflectance and texture of real-world surfaces|In this work, we investigate the visual appearance of real-world surfaces and the dependence of appearance on scale, viewing direction and illumination direction. At ne scale, surface variations cause local intensity variation or image texture. The appearance of this texture depends on both illumination and viewing direction and can be characterized by the BTF (bidirectional texture function). At su ciently coarse scale, local image texture is not resolvable and local image intensity is uniform. The dependence of this image intensity on illumination and viewing direction is described by the BRDF (bidirectional re ectance distribution function). We simultaneously measure the BTF and BRDF of over 60 di erent rough surfaces, each observed with over 200 di erent combinations of viewing and illumination direction. The resulting BTF database is comprised of over 12,000 image textures. To enable convenient use of the BRDF measurements, we t the measurements to two recent models and obtain a BRDF parameter database. These parameters can be used directly in image analysis and synthesis of a wide variety of surfaces. The BTF, BRDF, and BRDF parameter databases have important implications for computer vision and computer graphics and and each is made publicly available. 
469|Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes|We present a 3-D shape-based object recognition system for simultaneous recognition of multiple objects in scenes containing clutter and occlusion. Recognition is based on matching surfaces by matching points using the spin-image representation. The spin-image is a data level shape descriptor that is used to match surfaces represented as surface meshes. We present a compression scheme for spin-images that results in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust performance of recognition in the presence of clutter and occlusion through analysis of recognition trials on 100 scenes. This research was performed at Carnegie Mellon University and was supported by the US Department Surface matching is a technique from 3-D computer vision that has many applications in the area of robotics and automation. Through surface matching, an object can be recognized in a scene by comparing a sensed surface to an object surface stored in memory. When the object surface is matched to the scene surface, an association is made between something known (the object) and
470|The pyramid match kernel: Discriminative classification with sets of image features|Discriminative learning is challenging when examples are sets of features, and the sets vary in cardinality and lack any sort of meaningful ordering. Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences  generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This pyramid match computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches. 
471|Shape matching and object recognition using low distortion correspondence|We approach recognition in the framework of deformable shape matching, relying on a new algorithm for finding correspondences between feature points. This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48 % correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et als 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces. 1.
472|X-means: Extending K-means with Efficient Estimation of the Number of Clusters|Despite its popularity for general clustering, K-means suffers three major shortcomings; it scales poorly computationally, the number of clusters K has to be supplied by the user, and the search is prone to local minima. We propose solutions for the first two problems, and a partial remedy for the third. Building on prior work for algorithmic acceleration that is not based on approximation, we introduce a new algorithm that efficiently, searches the space of cluster locations and number of clusters to optimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) measure. The innovations include two new ways of exploiting cached sufficient statistics and a new very efficient test that in one K-means sweep selects the most promising subset of classes for refinement. This gives rise to a fast, statistically founded algorithm that outputs both the number of classes and their parameters. Experiments show this technique reveals the true number of classes in the underlying distribution, and that it is much faster than repeatedly using accelerated K-means for different values of K.
473|Using Maximum Entropy for Text Classification|This paper proposes the use of maximum entropy techniques for text classification. Maximum entropy is a probability distribution estimation technique widely used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that are uniform. Constraints on the distribution, derived from labeled training data, inform the technique where to be minimally non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation has a unique solution which can be found by the improved iterative scaling algorithm. In this paper, maximum entropy is used for text classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. In experiments on several text datasets we compare accuracy to naive Bayes and show that maximum entropy is sometimes significantly better, but also sometimes worse. Much future work remains, but the re...
474|Spectral grouping using the Nyström method| Spectral graph theoretic methods have recently shown great promise for the problem of image segmentation. However, due to the computational demands of these approaches, applications to large problems such as spatiotemporal data and high resolution imagery have been slow to appear. The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning making it feasible to apply them to very large grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems knownas the Nyström method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of &#034;typical&#034; samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels.
475|Learning a Sparse Representation for Object Detection|  We present an approach for learning to detect objects in still gray images, that is based on a sparse, part-based representation of objects. A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation. In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches.  
476|Creating efficient codebooks for visual recognition|Visual codebook based quantization of robust appearance descriptors extracted from local image patches is an effective means of capturing image statistics for texture analysis and scene classification. Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely (textons) or sparsely (bags of features  based on keypoints or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or Mutual Information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance. 1.
477|Recognition without Correspondence using Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms|. The appearance of an object is composed of local structure. This local structure can be described and characterized by a vector of local features measured by local operators such as Gaussian derivatives or Gabor filters. This article presents a technique where appearances of objects are represented by the joint statistics of such local neighborhood operators. As such, this represents a new class of appearance based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the paper develops techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that these techniques can identify over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the techniques have low complexity and therefore run in real-time.  1. Introduction  The paper proposes a framework for the statistical representation of the appearance of arbitrary 3D objects. This representation consists of a probability density function or jo...
478|Support vector machines for 3-D object recognition|Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been recently proposed as a new technique for pattern recognition. Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7,200 images of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition. 
479|object image library (COIL-100  (1996) |Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100) is a database of color images of 100 objects. The objects were placed on a motorized turntable against a black background. The turntable was rotated through 360 degrees to vary object pose with respect to a xed color camera. Images of the objects were taken at pose intervals of 5 degrees. This corresponds to 72 poses per object. The images were size normalized. COIL-100 is available online via ftp. i 1
480|A sparse texture representation using local affine regions|This article introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint changes and non-rigid deformations. At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classi-fication tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.
481|Recognition with Local Features: The Kernel Recipe|Recent developments in computer vision have shown that local features can provide efficient representations suitable for robust object recognition. Support Vector Machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches. 1.
482|Texture classification: Are filter banks necessary |We question the role that large scale filter banks have traditionally played in texture classification. It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighbourhoods (starting from as small as 3 × 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation which is suited to modelling this joint neighbourhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung &amp; Malik [IJCV 01], Cula &amp; Dana [CVPR 01], and Varma &amp; Zisserman [ECCV 02]. 1
483|Weak hypotheses and boosting for generic object detection and recognition|Abstract. In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting [5] as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a common framework: Boosting  together with a weak hypotheses finder  may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combination into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth [1] where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants [8] and SIFTs [12]. The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an interest point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses [22] or complex classifiers [20] have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art [3]. But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented regions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition. 1
484|A Kullback-Leibler Divergence Based Kernel for SVM Classification in Multimedia Applications|... In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure  to the Fisher kernel for systematically finding kernel functions that  naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia  domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we  explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well  known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single  full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance  based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between  generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of  both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the  standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker  identification/verification and image classification tasks and show  that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker  verification and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM&#039;s  and the generative classifiers in speaker identification and image  classification.
485|Recognizing Surfaces Using Three-Dimensional Textons|We study the recognition of surfaces made from different materials such as concrete, rug, marble or leather on the basis of their textural appearance. Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an  appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.  Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) ...
486|Semi-Local Affine Parts for Object Recognition|This paper proposes a new approach for finding expressive and geometrically invariant parts for modeling 3D objects. The approach relies on identifying groups of local affine regions (image features having a characteristic appearance and elliptical shape) that remain approximately affinely rigid across a range of views of an object, and across multiple instances of the same object class. These groups, termed semi-local affine parts, are learned using correspondence search between pairs of unsegmented and cluttered input images, followed by validation against additional training images. The proposed approach is applied to the recognition of butterflies in natural imagery. 1.
487|Categorizing Nine Visual Classes Using Local Appearance Descriptors|We present a novel method for generic visual categorization: the problem of identifying the object content of natural images while generalizing across variations inherent to the object class. This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naïve Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for classifying nine semantic visual categories and comment on results obtained by Fergus et al using a different method on the same data set. We obtain excellent results as well for multi class categorization as for object detection. A thorough evaluation clearly demonstrates that our method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information. 1.

489|Direct Computation of Shape Cues Using Scale-Adapted Spatial Derivative Operators|This paper addresses the problem of computing cues to the three-dimensional structure of surfaces in the world directly from the local structure of the brightness pattern of either a single monocular image or a binocular image pair. It is shown that starting from Gaussian derivatives of order up to two at a range of scales in scale-space, local estimates of (i) surface orientation from monocular texture foreshortening, (ii) surface orientation from monocular texture gradients, and (iii) surface orientation from the binocular disparity gradient can be computed without iteration or search, and by using essentially the same basic mechanism. The methodology is based on a multi-scale descriptor of image structure called the windowed second moment matrix, which is computed with adaptive selection of both scale levels and spatial positions. Notably, this descriptor comprises two scale parameters; a local scale parameter describing the amount of smoothing used in derivative computations, and a...
490|Efficient image matching with distributions of local invariant features|Sets of local features that are invariant to common image transformations are an effective representation to use when comparing images; current methods typically judge feature sets  similarity via a voting scheme (which ignores co-occurrence statistics) or by comparing histograms over a set of prototypes (which must be found by clustering). We present a method for efficiently comparing images based on their discrete distributions (bags) of distinctive local invariant features, without clustering descriptors. Similarity between images is measured with an approximation of the Earth Movers Distance (EMD), which quickly computes minimal-cost correspondences between two bags of features. Each images feature distribution is mapped into a normed space with a low-distortion embedding of EMD. Examples most similar to a novel query image are retrieved in time sublinear in the number of examples via approximate nearest neighbor search in the embedded space. We evaluate our method with scene, object, and texture recognition tasks. 1.
491|On the significance of real-world conditions for material classification |Abstract. Classifying materials from their appearance is a challenging problem, especially if illumination and pose conditions are permitted to change: highlights and shadows caused by 3D structure can radically alter a samples visual texture. Despite these difficulties, researchers have demonstrated impressive results on the CUReT database which contains many images of 61 materials under different conditions. A first contribution of this paper is to further advance the state-of-theart by applying Support Vector Machines to this problem. To our knowledge, we record the best results to date on the CUReT database. In our work we additionally investigate the effect of scale since robustness to viewing distance and zoom settings is crucial in many real-world situations. Indeed, a materials appearance can vary considerably as fine-level detail becomes visible or disappears as the camera moves towards or away from the subject. We handle scale-variations using a pure-learning approach, incorporating samples imaged at different distances into the training set. An empirical investigation is conducted to show how the classification accuracy decreases as less scale information is made available during training. Since the CUReT database contains little scale variation, we introduce a new database which images ten CUReT materials at different distances, while also maintaining some change in pose and illumination. The first aim of the database is thus to provide scale variations, but a second and equally important objective is to attempt to recognise different samples of the CUReT materials. For instance, does training on the CUReT database enable recognition of another piece of sandpaper? The results clearly demonstrate that it is not possible to do so with any acceptable degree of accuracy. Thus we conclude that impressive results even on a well-designed database such as CUReT, does not imply that material classification is close to being a solved problem under real-world conditions. 1
492|Discriminative Training for Object Recognition using Image Patches |We present a method for automatically learning discriminative image patches for the recognition of given object classes. The approach applies discriminative training of log-linear models to image patch histograms. We show that it works well on three tasks and performs significantly better than other methods using the same features. For example, the method decides that patches containing an eye are most important for distinguishing face from background images. The recognition performance is very competitive with error rates presented in other publications. In particular, a new best error rate for the Caltech motorbikes data of 1.5 % is achieved. 1.
493|Cue integration through discriminative accumulation |Object recognition systems aiming to work in real world settings should use multiple cues in order to achieve robustness. We present a new cue integration scheme which extends the idea of cue accumulation to discriminative classifiers. We derive and test the scheme for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), but we also show that it is easily extendible to any large margin classifier. Interestingly, in the case of one-class SVMs, the scheme can be interpreted as a new class of Mercer kernels for multiple cues. Experimental comparison with a probabilistic accumulation scheme is favorable to our method. Comparison with voting scheme shows that our method may suffer as the number of object classes increases. Based on these results, we propose a recognition algorithm consisting of a decision tree where decisions at each node are taken using our accumulation scheme. Results obtained using this new algorithm compare very favorably to accumulation (both probabilistic and discriminative) and voting scheme. 1
494|Object categorization with SVM: Kernels for local features|In this paper, we propose to combine an efficient image representation based on local descriptors with a Support Vector Machine classifier in order to perform object categorization. For this purpose, we apply kernels defined on sets of vectors. After testing different combinations of kernel / local descriptors, we have been able to identify a very performant one. 1
495|Support Vector Machines For Region-Based Image Retrieval|In this paper, the application of support vector machines (SVM) in relevance feedback for region-based image retrieval is investigated. Both the one class SVM as a class distribution estimator and two classes SVM as a classifier are taken into account. For the latter, two representative display strategies are studied. Since the common kernels often rely on inner product or Lp norm in the input space, they are infeasible in the region-based image retrieval systems that use variable-length representations. To resolve the issue, a new kind of kernel that is a generalization of Gaussian kernel is proposed. Experimental results on a database of 10,000 generalpurpose images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.
496|Improving a discriminative approach to object recognition using image patches|Abstract. In this paper we extend a method that uses image patch histograms and discriminative training to recognize objects in cluttered scenes. The method generalizes and performs well for different tasks, e.g. for radiograph recognition and recognition of objects in cluttered scenes. Here, we further investigate this approach and propose several extensions. Most importantly, the method is substantially improved by adding multi-scale features so that it better accounts for objects of different sizes. Other extensions tested include the use of Sobel features, the generalization of histograms, a method to account for varying image brightness in the PCA domain, and SVMs for classification. The results are improved significantly, i.e. on average we have a 59 % relative reduction of the error rate and we are able to obtain a new best error rate of 1.1 % on the Caltech motorbikes task. 1

Nous décrivons une application de ces techniques à la catégorisation dimages par sacs de primitives (bags of features) et montrons que les résultats obtenus sont très supérieurs à ceux obtenus par les méthodes concurrentes.
498|Object categorization via local kernels|In this paper we consider the problem of multi-object categorization. We present an algorithm that combines support vector machines with local features via a new class of Mercer kernels. This class of kernels allows us to perform scalar products on feature vectors consisting of local descriptors, computed around interest points (like corners); these feature vectors are generally of different lengths for different images. The resulting framework is able to recognize multi-object categories in different settings, from lab-controlled to real-world scenes. We present several experiments, on different databases, and we benchmark our results with state-of-the-art algorithms for categorization, achieving excellent results. 1
499|A Sparse Texture Representation Using Local Ane Regions |This article introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint changes and non-rigid deformations. At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of ane Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an ane-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When ane invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classi-cation tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from dierent viewpoints.
500|A metric for distributions with applications to image databases|We introduce a new distance between two distributions that we call the Earth Movers Distance (EMD), which reflects the minimal amount of work that must be performed to transform one distributioninto the other by moving distribution mass  around. This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching. When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search. 1
501|Similarity of Color Images|We describe two new color indexing techniques. The first one is a more robust version of the commonly used color histogram indexing. In the index we store the cumulative color histograms. The L 1 -, L 2 -, or L1 -distance between two cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these two color distributions. We show that while this method produces only slightly better results than color histogram methods, it is more robust with respect to the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions, the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between corresponding mo...
502|Image Representation Using 2D Gabor Wavelets|This paper extends to two dimensions the frame criterion developed by Daubechies for one-dimensional wavelets, and it computes the frame bounds for the particular case of 2D Gabor wavelets. Completeness criteria for 2D Gabor image representations are important because of their increasing role in many computer vision applications and also in modeling biological vision, since recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response profiles of the main class of linearly-responding cortical neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family of self-similar 2D Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive the conditions under which a set of continuous 2D Gabor wavelets will provide a complete representation of any image, and we also find self-similar wavelet parameterizations which allow stable reconstruction by summation as though the wavelets formed an orthonormal basis. Approximating a &#034;tight frame&#034; generates redundancy which allows low-resolution neural responses to represent high-resolution images, as we illustrate by image reconstructions with severely quantized 2D Gabor coefficients. Index Terms---Gabor wavelets, coarse coding, image representation, visual cortex, image reconstruction.
503|The earth movers distance, multi-dimensional scaling, and color-based image retrieval|In this paper we present a novel approach tothe problem of navigating through a database of color images. We consider the images as points in a metric space in which we wish to move around so as to locate image neighborhoods of interest, based on color information. The data base images are mapped to distributions in color space, these distributions are appropriately compressed, and then the distances between all pairs I;J of images are computed based on the work needed to rearrange the mass in the compressed distribution representing I to that of J. We also propose the use of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques to embed a group of images as points in a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances are preserved as much as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group. In particular, displays of 2-d MDS embeddings can be used to organize and re ne the results of a nearest-neighbor query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user is able to quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest. 1
504|The Aurora Experimental Framework for the Performance Evaluation of Speech Recognition Systems under Noisy Conditions|This paper describes a database designed to evaluate the performance of speech recognition algorithms in noisy conditions. The database may either be used to measure frontend feature extraction algorithms, using a defined HMM recognition back-end, or complete recognition systems. The source speech for this database is the TIdigits, consisting of connected digits task spoken by American English talkers (downsampled to 8kHz). A selection of 8 different real-world noises have been added to the speech over a range of signal to noise ratios with controlled filtering of the speech and noise. The framework was prepared as a contribution to the ETSI STQ-AURORA DSR Working Group[1]. Aurora is developing standards for Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR) where the speech analysis is done in the telecommunication terminal and the recognition at a central location in the telecom network. The framework is currently being used to evaluate alternative proposals for front-end feature extraction. The database has been made publicly available through ELRA so that other speech researchers to evaluate and compare the performance of noise robust algorithms. Recognition results will be presented for the first standard DSR feature extraction scheme based on a cepstral analysis. 1.

It runs at 10Hz on a standard SGI Indy computer, and has performed reliably on thousands of people in many different physical locations. The system uses a multiclass statistical model of color and shape to obtain a 2D representation of head and hands in a wide range of viewing conditions. Pfinder has been successfully used in a wide range of applications including wireless interfaces, video databases, and low-bandwidth coding.

In addition to adding focal length to the state vector, several representational improvements are made over earlier structure from motion for-mulations, yielding a stable and accurate estimation framework which applies uniformly to both true perspective and ortho-graphic projection. Results on synthetic and real imagery illus-trate the performance of the estimator.  
508|Visual Tracking of High DOF Articulated Structures: an Application to Human Hand Tracking|. Passive sensing of human hand and limb motion is important for a wide range of applications from human-computer interaction to athletic performance measurement. High degree of freedom articulated mechanisms like the human hand are difficult to track because of their large state space and complex image appearance. This article describes a model-based hand tracking system, called DigitEyes, that can recover the state of a 27 DOF hand model from ordinary gray scale images at speeds of up to 10 Hz. 1 Introduction Sensing of human hand and limb motion is important in applications from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to athletic performance measurement. Current commercially available solutions are invasive, and require the user to don gloves [15] or wear targets [8]. This paper describes a noninvasive visual hand tracking system, called DigitEyes. We have demonstrated hand tracking at speeds of up to 10 Hz using line and point features extracted from gray scale images of unadorne...
509|Compact Representations Of Videos Through Dominant And Multiple Motion Estimation|An explosion of on-line image and video data in digital form is already well underway. With the exponential rise in interactive information exploration and dissemination through the WorldWide Web (WWW), the major inhibitors of rapid access to on-line video data are costs and management of capture and storage, lack of real-time delivery, and non-availability of contentbased intelligent search and indexing techniques. The solutions for capture, storage and delivery maybe on the horizon or a little beyond. However, even with rapid delivery, the lack of efficient authoring and querying tools for visual content-based indexing may still inhibit as widespread a use of video information as that of text and traditional tabular data is currently. In order to be able to non-linearly browse and index into videos through visual content, it is necessary to develop authoring tools that can automatically separate moving objects and significant components of the scene, and represent these in a compact ...
510|An Efficient Method for Contour Tracking using Active Shape Models|There has been considerable research interest recently, in the areas of real time contour tracking and active shape models. This paper demonstrates how dynamic filtering can be used in combination with a flexible shape model to track an articulated non-rigid body in motion. The results show the method being used to track the silhouette of a walking pedestrian across a scene in real time. The active shape model used was generated automatically from real image data and incorporates variability in shape due to orientation as well as object flexibility. A Kalman filter is used to control spatial scale for feature search over successive frames and for contour refinement on an individual frame. Iterative refinement allows accurate contour localisation where feasible, although there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The shape model incorporates knowledge of the likely shape of the contour and speeds up tracking by reducing the number of system parameters. A further increase in speed ...
511|Towards 3-D model-based tracking and recognition of human movement: a multi-view approach|In this paper we describe our work on 3-D modelbased tracking and recognition of human movement from real images. Our system has two major components. The first component takes real image sequences acquired from multiple views and recovers the 3-D body pose at each time instant. The poserecovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails finding the pose parameters of a graphical human model for which its synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. Currently, we use a best-first search technique and chamfer matching as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. The second component of our system deals with the representation and recognition of human movement patterns. The recognition of human movement patterns is considered as a classification problem involving the matching of a test sequence with several reference sequences representing prototypical activities. A variation of dynamic ti...
512|Cooperative Robust Estimation Using Layers of Support|We present an approach to the problem of representing images that contain multiple objects or surfaces. Rather than use an edge-based approach to represent the segmentation of a scene, we propose a multi-layer estimation framework which uses support maps to represent the segmentation of the image into homogeneous chunks. This support-based approach can represent objects that are split into disjoint regions, or have surfaces that are transparently interleaved. Our framework is based on an extension of robust estimation methods which provide a theoretical basis for supportbased estimation. The Minimum Description Length principle is used to decide how many support maps to use in describing a particular image. We show results applying this framework to heterogeneous interpolation and segmentation tasks on range and motion imagery. 1 Introduction  Real-world perceptual systems must deal with complicated and cluttered environments. To succeed in such environments, a system must be able to r...
513|Segmenting Simply Connected Moving Objects in a Static Scene|A new segmentation algorithm is derived, based on an object-background probability estimate exploiting the experimental fact that the statistics of local image derivatives show a Laplacian distribution. The objects&#039; simply connectedness is included directly into the probability estimate and leads to an iterative optimization approach that can be implemented efficiently. This new approach avoids early thresholding, explicit edge detection, motion analysis, and grouping. Contribution type: Correspondence 1  This work was supported by the consortium VISAGE and KWF grant No. 2440.1  1 Introduction  In many object recognition applications the objects of interest are moving whereas the background is static or can be stabilized [1, 2]. Motion segmentation can enormously simplify, subsequent object recognition steps. Therefore, detecting and segmenting moving objects in a static scene is an important computer vision task. In recent years a number of different approaches have been proposed for...
514|`Video orbits&#039;: characterizing the coordinate transformation between two images using the projective group|Many applications in computer vision benefit from accurate,robust analysis of the coordinate transformation between two frames. Whether for image mosaicing, camera motion description, video stabilization, image enhancement, aligning digital photographs for modification (e.g. ad-insertment), or their comparison during retrieval, finding both an estimate of the coordinate transformation between two images, and the error in this estimate is important. Perhaps the most frequently used coordinate transformation is based on the 6-parameter affine model; it is simple to implement and captures camera translation, zoom, and rotation. Higher order models, such as the 8-parameter bilinear, 8-parameter pseudo-perspective, or 12-parameter `biquadratic&#039;, have also been proposed to approximately capture the two extra degrees of freedom that a camera has (pan, tilt) that are not captured by the affine model. However, none of these models exactly captures the eight parameters of camera motion. The desired parameters are those of elements in the projective group, which map the values at location x to those at location x&#039; = (Ax + b)/(cTx + 1), where the numerator contains the six affine parameters, and the denominator contains the two additional pan-tilt or &#034;chirp&#034; parameters, c. This paper presents a new method to estimate these eight parameters from two images. The method works without feature correspondences, and without the huge computation demanded by direct nonlinear optimization algorithms. The method yields the &#034;exact&#034; eight parameters for the two no-parallax cases: 1) a rigid planar patch, with arbitrary 3D camera translation, rotation, pan, tilt, and zoom; and 2) an arbitrary 3D scene, with arbitrary camera rotation, pan, tilt, and zoom about a fixed center of projection. We demonstrate the proposed method on real image pairs and discuss new applications for facilitating logging and browsing of video databases.
515|On optimistic methods for concurrency control|Most current approaches to concurrency control in database systems rely on locking of data objects as a control mechanism. In this paper, two families of nonlocking concurrency controls are presented. The methods used are optimistic  in the sense that they rely mainly on transaction backup as a control mechanism, hoping  that conflicts between transactions will not occur. Applications for which these methods should be more efficient than locking are discussed.
516|Efficient Locking for Concurrent Operations on B-Trees|The B-tree and its variants have been found to be highly useful (both theoretically and in practice) for storing large amounts ofinformation, especially on secondary storage devices. We examine the problem of overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional link  pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal correctness proof for our system is given,
517|Concurrent manipulation of binary search trees|The concurrent manipulation of a binary search tree is considered in this paper. The systems presented can support any number of concurrent processes which perform searching, insertion, deletion, and rotation (reorganization) on the tree, but allow any process to lock only a constant number of nodes at any time. Also, in the systems, searches are essentially never blocked. The concurrency control techniques introduced in the paper include the use of special nodes and pointers to redirect searches, and the use of copies of sections of the tree to introduce many changes simultaneously and therefore avoid unpredictable interleaving. Methods developed in this paper may provide new insights into other problems in the area of concurrent database manipulation.
518|An optimality theory of concurrency control for databases|In many database applications it is desirable that the database system be time-shared among multiple users who access the database in an interactive way. In such a systewi the arriving requests for the execution of steps in
519|Prefix B-trees|Two modifications of B-trees are described, simple prefix B-trees and prefix B-trees. Both store only parts of keys, namely prefixes, in the index part of a B*-tree. In simple prefix B-trees those prefixes are selected carefully to minimize their length. In prefix B-trees the pre-fixes need not he fully stored, but are reconstructed as the tree is searched. Prefix B-trees are designed to combine some of the advantages of B-trees, digital search trees, and key compres-sion techniques while reducing the processing overhead of compression techniques.
520|Efficiently mining long patterns from databases|We present a pattern-mining algorithm that scales roughly linearly in the number of maximal patterns embedded in a database irrespective of the length of the longest pattern. In comparison, previous algorithms based on Apriori scale exponentially with longest pattern length. Experiments on real data show that when the patterns are long, our algorithm is more efficient by an order of magnimaximal frequent itemset, Max-Miners output implicitly and concisely represents all frequent itemsets. Max-Miner is shown to result in two or more orders of magnitude in performance improvements over Apriori on some data-sets. On other data-sets where the patterns are not so long, the gains are more modest. In practice, Max-Miner is demonstrated to run in time that is roughly linear in the number of maximal frequent itemsets and the size of the database, irrespective of the size of the longest frequent itemset. tude or more. 1.
521|Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules|We consider the problem of discovering association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions. We present two new algorithms for solving this problem that are fundamentally different from the known algorithms. Empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of magnitude for large problems. We also show how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database. 
522|Mining Sequential Patterns|We are given a large database of customer transactions, where each transaction consists of customer-id, transaction time, and the items bought in the transaction. We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction.  
523|Mining Sequential Patterns: Generalizations and Performance Improvements|Abstract. The problem of mining sequential patterns was recently introduced in [3]. We are given a database of sequences, where each sequence is a list of transactions ordered by transaction-time, and each transaction is a set of items. The problem is to discover all sequential patterns with a user-speci ed minimum support, where the support of a pattern is the number of data-sequences that contain the pattern. An example of a sequential pattern is \5 % of customers bought `Foundation&#039; and `Ringworld &#039; in one transaction, followed by `Second Foundation &#039; in a later transaction&#034;. We generalize the problem as follows. First, we add time constraints that specify a minimum and/or maximum time period between adjacent elements in a pattern. Second, we relax the restriction that the items in an element of a sequential pattern must come from the same transaction, instead allowing the items to be present in a set of transactions whose transaction-times are within a user-speci ed time window. Third, given a user-de ned taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) on items, we allow sequential patterns to include items across all levels of the taxonomy. We present GSP, a new algorithm that discovers these generalized sequential patterns. Empirical evaluation using synthetic and real-life data indicates that GSP is much faster than the AprioriAll algorithm presented in [3]. GSP scales linearly with the number of data-sequences, and has very good scale-up properties with respect to the average datasequence size. 1
524|Dynamic Itemset Counting and Implication Rules for Market Basket Data|We consider the problem of analyzing market-basket data and present several important contributions. First, we present a new algorithm for finding large itemsets which uses fewer passes over the data than classic algorithms, and yet uses fewer candidate itemsets than methods based on sampling. We investigate the idea of item reordering, which can improve the low-level efficiency of the algorithm. Second, we present a new way of generating &#034;implication rules,&#034; which are normalized based on both the antecedent and the consequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence), and we show how they produce more intuitive results than other methods. Finally, we show how different characteristics of real data, as opposed to synthetic data, can dramatically affect the performance of the system and the form of the results.  1 Introduction  Within the area of data mining, the problem of deriving associations from data has recently received a great deal of attention. The prob...
525|An efficient algorithm for mining association rules in large databases|Mining for a.ssociation rules between items in a large database of sales transactions has been described as an important database mining problem. In this paper we present an effi-cient algorithm for mining association rules that is fundamentally different from known al-gorithms. Compared to previous algorithms, our algorithm not only reduces the I/O over-head significantly but also has lower CPU overhead for most cases. We have performed extensive experiments and compared the per-formance of our algorithm with one of the best existing algorithms. It was found that for large databases, the CPU overhead was re-duced by as much as a factor of four and I/O was reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Hence this algorithm is especially suitable for very large size databases. 1
526|New Algorithms for Fast Discovery of Association Rules|Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented, which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques. The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) d...
527|Mining Association Rules with Item Constraints|The problem of discovering association rules has received considerable research attention and several fast algorithms for mining association rules have been developed. In practice, users are often interested in a subset of association rules. For example, they may only want rules that contain a specific item or rules that contain children of a specific item in a hierarchy. While such constraints can be applied as a postprocessing step, integrating them into the mining algorithm can dramatically reduce the execution time. We consider the problem of integrating constraints that are boolean expressions over the presence or absence of items into the association discovery algorithm. We present three integrated algorithms for mining association rules with item constraints and discuss their tradeoffs. 1. Introduction The problem of discovering association rules was introduced in (Agrawal, Imielinski, &amp; Swami 1993). Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of literals (call...
528|Search through systematic set enumeration|In many problem domains, solutions take the form of unordered sets. We present the Set-Enumerations (SE)-tree- a vehicle for representing sets and/or enumerating them in a best-first fashion. We demonstrate its usefulness as the basis for a unifying search-based framework for domains where minimal (maximal) elements of a power set are targeted, where minimal (maximal) partial instantiations of a set of variables are sought, or where a composite decision is not dependent on the order in which its primitive component-decisions are taken. Particular instantiations of SE-tree-based algorithms for some AI problem domains are used to demonstrate the general features of the approach. These algorithms are compared theoretically and empirically with current algorithms.
529|Pincer-Search: A New Algorithm for Discovering the Maximum Frequent Set|Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up breadth-first search direction. The computation starts from frequent 1-itemsets (minimal length frequent itemsets) and continues until all maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform reasonably well when all maximal frequent itemsets are short. However, performance drastically decreases when some of the maximal frequent itemsets are relatively long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up and top-down directions. The main search direction is still bottom-up but a restricted search is conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating a new data structure we designed, the maximum frequent candidat...
530|Brute-Force Mining of High-Confidence Classification Rules|This paper investigates a brute-force technique for mining classification rules from large data sets. We employ an association rule miner enhanced with new prun ing strategies to control combinatorial explosion in the number of candidates counted with each database pass. The approach effectively and efficiently extracts high confidence classification rules that apply to most if not all of the data in several classification benchmarks.  Introduction  Several data mining tasks require dividing up the entities of a database into various classes. Junk-mailers are wellknown users of classification technology, using it to avoid sending out flyers to persons unlikely to be interested in the product being promoted. The task requires a classifier that  is usually automatically generated from a &#034;training database &#034; of pre-classified entities. Several approaches have appeared in the AI, statistics, and data-mining literature, and some methods made to scale to large data sets [Shafer et al. 96]. B...
531|Model-Based Clustering, Discriminant Analysis, and Density Estimation|Cluster analysis is the automated search for groups of related observations in a data set. Most clustering done in practice is based largely on heuristic but intuitively reasonable procedures and most clustering methods available in commercial software are also of this type. However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as \How many clusters are there?&#034;, &#034;Which clustering method should be used?&#034; and \How should outliers be handled?&#034;. We outline a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, mineeld detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology, a...
532|Bayes Factors|In a 1935 paper, and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P -values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this paper we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology and psychology.
534|Bayesian Density Estimation and Inference Using Mixtures|We describe and illustrate Bayesian inference in models for density estimation using mixtures of Dirichlet processes. These models provide natural settings for density estimation, and are exemplified by special cases where data are modelled as a sample from mixtures of normal distributions. Efficient simulation methods are used to approximate various prior, posterior and predictive distributions. This allows for direct inference on a variety of practical issues, including problems of local versus global smoothing, uncertainty about density estimates, assessment of modality, and the inference on the numbers of components. Also, convergence results are established for a general class of normal mixture models.

535|Bayesian Model Selection in Social Research (with Discussion by Andrew Gelman &amp; Donald B. Rubin, and Robert M. Hauser, and a Rejoinder)  (1995) |It is argued that P-values and the tests based upon them give unsatisfactory results, especially in large samples. It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward using the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of non-nested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis...
537|Regularized discriminant analysis|Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis are considered in the small sample high-dimensional setting. Alternatives to the usual maximum likelihood (plug-in) estimates for the covariance matrices are proposed. These alternatives are characterized by two parameters, the values of which are customized to individual situations by jointly minimizing a sample based estimate of future misclassification risk. Computationally fast implementations are presented, and the efficacy of the approach is examined through simulation studies and application to data. These studies indicate that in many circumstances dramatic gains in classification accuracy can be achieved. Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association
539|Discriminant Analysis by Gaussian Mixtures|Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a valuable tool for multigroup classification. LDA is equivalent to maximum likelihood classification assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. In this paper, we fit Gaussian mixtures to each class to facilitate effective classification in non-normal settings, especially when the classes are clustered. Low dimensional views are an important by-product of LDA---our new techniques inherit this feature. We are able to control the within-class spread of the subclass centers relative to the between-class spread. Our technique for fitting these models permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions of LDA.  Keywords: Classification, Pattern Recognition, Clustering, Nonparametric, Penalized. 1 Introduction  In the generic classification or discrimination problem, the outcome of interest  G falls into J unordered classes, which for convenience we denote by the set J =  f1; 2; 3; \Delta \Delta \Delta Jg. We wish to build a rule for pred...
540|Practical Bayesian Density Estimation Using Mixtures Of Normals|this paper, we propose some solutions to these problems. Our goal is to come up with a simple, practical method for estimating the density. This is an interesting problem in its own right, as well as a first step towards solving other inference problems, such as providing more flexible distributions in hierarchical models. To see why the posterior is improper under the usual reference prior, we write the model in the following way. Let Z = (Z 1 ; : : : ; Z n ) and X = (X 1 ; : : : ; X n ). The Z
542|Detecting Features in  Spatial Point Processes with . . .|We consider the problem of detecting features in spatial point processes in the presence of substantial clutter. One example is the detection of mine elds using reconnaissance aircraft images that erroneously identify many objects that are not mines. Another is the detection of seismic faults on the basis of earthquake catalogs: earthquakes tend to be clustered close to the faults, but there are many that are farther away. Our solution uses model-based clustering based on a mixture model for the process, in which features are assumed to generate points according to highly linear multivariate normal densities, and the clutter arises according to a spatial Poisson process. Very nonlinear features are represented by several highly linear multivariate normal densities, giving a piecewise linear representation. The model is estimated in two stages. In the rst stage, hierarchical model-based clustering is used to provide a rst estimate of the features. In the second stage, this clustering is re ned using the EM algorithm. The number of features is found using an approximation to the posterior probability of each number of features. For the minefield
543|MCLUST: Software for Model-based Cluster Analysis|MCLUST is a software package for cluster analysis written in Fortran and interfaced to the S-PLUS commercial software package1. It implements parameterized Gaussian hierarchical clustering algorithms [16, 1, 7] and the EM algorithm for parameterized Gaussian mixture models [5, 13, 3, 14] with the possible addition of a Poisson noise term. MCLUST also includes functions that combine hierarchical clustering, EM and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in a comprehensive clustering strategy [4, 8]. Methods of this type have shown promise in a number of practical applications, including character recognition [16], tissue segmentation [1], mine eld and seismic fault detection [4], identi cation of textile aws from images [2], and classi cation of astronomical data [3, 15].

545|Regularized Gaussian Discriminant Analysis Through Eigenvalue Decomposition|Friedman (1989) has proposed a regularization technique (RDA) of discriminant analysis in the Gaussian framework. RDA makes use of two regularization parameters to design an intermediate classi cation rule between linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to design classi cation rules which have also a median position between linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. Our approach is based on the reparametrization of the covariance matrix k of a group Gk in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition, k = kDkAkD 0 k where k speci es the volume of Gk, Ak its shape, and Dk its orientation. Variations on constraints concerning k?Ak and Dk lead to 14 discrimination models of interest. For each model, we derived the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and our approach consists in selecting the model among the 14 possible models by minimizing the sample-based estimate of future misclassi cation risk by cross-validation. Numerical experiments show favorable behavior of this approach as compared to RDA.
546|Scaling EM (Expectation-Maximization) Clustering to Large Databases  (1999) |Practical statistical clustering algorithms typically center upon an iterative refinement optimization procedure to compute a locally optimal clustering solution that maximizes the fit to data. These algorithms typically require many database scans to converge, and within each scan they require the access to every record in the data table. For large databases, the scans become prohibitively expensive. We present a scalable implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The database community has focused on distance-based clustering schemes and methods have been developed to cluster either numerical or categorical data. Unlike distancebased algorithms (such as K-Means), EM constructs proper statistical models of the underlying data source and naturally generalizes to cluster databases containing both discrete-valued and continuous-valued data. The scalable method is based on a decomposition of the basic statistics the algorithm needs: identifying regions of the data that...
547|Averaging, Maximum Penalized Likelihood and Bayesian Estimation for Improving Gaussian Mixture Probability Density Estimates|We apply the idea of averaging ensembles of estimators to probability density estimation.
548|Non Parametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Features in . . .|This paper addresses the problem of estimating the support domain of a bounded point process in presence of background noise. This situation occurs for example in the detection of a mine field from aerial observations. A Maximum Likelihood Estimator for a mixture of uniform point processes is derived using a natural partition of the space defined by the data themselves: the Voronoï tessellation. The methodology is tested on simulations and compared to a model-based clustering technique.
549|Inference in model-based cluster analysis|A new approach to cluster analysis has been introduced based on parsimonious geometric modelling of the within-group covariance matrices in a mixture of multivariate normal distributions, using hierarchical agglomeration and iterative relocation. It works well and is widely used via the MCLUST software available in S-PLUS and StatLib. However, it has several limitations: there is no assessment of the uncertainty about the classification, the partition can be suboptimal, parameter estimates are biased, the shape matrix has to be specified by the user, prior group probabilities are assumed to be equal, the method for choosing the number of groups is based on a crude approximation, and no formal way of choosing between the various possible models is included. Here, we propose a new approach which overcomes all these difficulties. It consists of exact Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling, and the calculation of Bayes factors (for choosing the model and the number of groups) from the output using the Laplace-Metropolis estimator. It works well in several real and simulated examples.  
550|Principal curve clustering with noise|was supported by ONR grants N00014-96-1-0192 and N00014-96-1-0330. The authors are Clustering on principal curves combines parametric modeling of noise with nonparametric modeling of feature shape. This is useful for detecting curvilinear features in spatial point patterns, with or without background noise. Applications of this include the detection of curvilinear mine elds from reconnaissance images, some of the points in which represent false detections, and the detection of seismic faults from earthquake catalogs. Our algorithm for principal curve clustering is in two steps: the rst is hierarchical and agglomerative (HPCC), and the second consists of iterative relocation based on the Classi cation EM algorithm (CEM-PCC). HPCC is used to combine potential feature clusters, while CEM-PCC re nes the results and deals with background noise. It is importanttohave a good starting point for the algorithm: this can be found manually or automatically using, for example, nearest neighbor clutter removal or model-based clustering. We choose the number of features and the amount of smoothing simultaneously using approximate Bayes
551|Fitting mixtures of Kent distributions to aid in joint set identification|When examining a rock mass, joint sets and their orientations can play a significant role with regard to how the rock mass will behave. To identify joint sets present in the rock mass, the orientation of individual fracture planes can be measured on exposed rock faces and the resulting data can be examined for heterogeneity. In this article, the expectationmaximization algorithm is used to fit mixtures of Kent component distributions to the fracture data to aid in the identification of joint sets. An additional uniform component is also included in the model to accommodate the noise present in the data.
552|From Massive Data Sets to Science Catalogs: Applications and Challenges|With hardware advances in scientific instruments and data gathering techniques comes the  inevitable flood of data that can render traditional approaches to science data analysis severely  inadequate. The traditional approach of manual and exhaustive analysis of a data set is no longer  feasible for many tasks ranging from remote sensing, astronomy, and atmospherics to medicine,  molecular biology, and biochemistry. In this paper we present our views as practitioners engaged  in building computational systems to help scientists deal with large data sets. We focus on  what we view as challenges and shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art in data analysis in  view of the massive data sets that are still awaiting analysis. The presentation is grounded in  applications in astronomy, planetary sciences, solar physics, and atmospherics that are currently  driving much of our work at JPL.  keywords: science data analysis, limitations of current methods, challenges for massive data sets, ...
553|Multicast Routing in Datagram Internetworks and Extended LANs|Multicasting, the transmission of a packet to a group of hosts, is an important service for improving the efficiency and robustness of distributed systems and applications. Although multicast capability is available and widely used in local area networks, when those LANs are interconnected by store-and-forward routers, the multicast service is usually not offered across the resulting internetwork. To address this limitation, we specify extensions to two common internetwork routing algorithms-distance-vector routing and link-state routing-to support low-delay datagram multicasting beyond a single LAN. We also describe modifications to the single-spanning-tree routing algorithm commonly used by link-layer bridges, to reduce the costs of multicasting in large extended LANs. Finally, we discuss how the use of multicast scope control and hierarchical multicast routing allows the multicast service to scale up to large internetworks.
554|vic: A Flexible Framework for Packet Video|The deployment of IP Multicast has fostered the development of a suite of applications, collectively known as the MBone tools, for real-time multimedia conferencingover the Internet. Two of these tools --- nv from Xerox PARC and ivs from INRIA --- provide video transmission using softwarebased codecs. We describe a new video tool, vic, that extends the groundbreaking work of nv and ivs with a more flexible system architecture. This flexibility is characterized by network layer independence, support for hardware-based codecs, a conference coordination model, an extensible user interface, and support for diverse compression algorithms. We also propose a novel compression scheme called &#034;IntraH. 261&#034;. Created as a hybrid of the nv and ivs codecs, IntraH. 261 provides a factor of 2-3 improvement in compression gain over the nv encoder (6 dB of PSNR) as well as a substantial improvement in run-time performance over the ivs H.261 coder.

555|A High Performance Totally Ordered Multicast Protocol|This paper presents the Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP). RMP provides a totally ordered, reliable, atomic multicast service on top of an unreliable multicast datagram service such as IP Multicasting. RMP is fully and symmetrically distributed so that no site bears an undue portion of the communication load. RMP provides a wide range of guarantees, from unreliable delivery to totally ordered delivery, to K-resilient, majority resilient, and totally resilient atomic delivery. These QoS guarantees are selectable on a per packet basis. RMP provides many communication options, including virtual synchrony, a publisher/subscriber model of message delivery, a client/server model of delivery, an implicit naming service, mutually exclusive handlers for messages, and mutually exclusive locks.
556|Broadcast protocols for distributed systems|Abstract-We present an innovative approach to the design of faulttolerant distributed systems that avoids the several rounds of message exchange required by current protocols for consensus agreement. The processors agree on exactly the same sequence of broadcast messages. approach is based on broadcast communication over a local area network, such as an Ethernet or a token ring, and on two novel protocols, It is easy to demonstrate that placing a total order on broadcast messages, so that every working processor procthe Tram protocol, which provides efficient reliable broadcast communi- esses the same messages in the same order, provides an cation, and the Total protocol, which with high probability promptly places a total order on messages and achieves distributed agreement even in the presence of fail-stoo. omission. timing, and communication faults. Reliable distributed operations such as locking, update and commitment, typically require only a single broadcast message rather than the several immediate solution to the agreement problem. Once this total order is determined, distributed actions can be carried out using simple sequential fault-tolerant algorithms. The strategy is very efficient: for example, locking records in a distributed tens of messages required by current algorithms. database typically requires only a single broadcast message to claim a lock and a single broadcast message to release it. Index Terms-Agreement problem, broadcast communication, communication protocols, distributed systems, fault tolerance, local area networks, total order. Based on this strategy, it is possible to design simple and efficient but very robust distributed systems.
557|A Distributed Whiteboard for Network Conferencing|Advances in network technology and research in real-time packet-switched networks have prompted the emergence of internet conferencing. While audio and video conferencing tools are readily available, shared workspaces and drawing tools have been slower to emerge. We present a design for a network conferencing whiteboard that differs in notable respects from other shared workspace prototypes. We describe its transport layer, based on IP multicasting and application level framing, and its object oriented imaging model, based on persistent PostScript graphics operations. We then propose a user interface, and finally, describe a C++ implementation based on the InterViews structured graphics library. 1 Introduction  In the early days of the Internet, experiments with packet voice proved that computer networks could be used for integrated services [5]. However, the technological limitations of the time made such use impractical. This is now changing. Dramatic advances in network bandwidth an...
558|Surface Reflection: Physical and Geometrical Perspectives|Machine vision can greatly benefit from the development of accurate reflectance models. There are two approaches to the study of reflection: physical and geometrical optics. While geometrical models may be consumed as mere approximations to physical models, they possess simpler mathematical forms that often render them more usable than physical models. However, geometrical models are applicable only when the wavelength of incident light is small compared to the dimensions of the surface imperfections. Therefore, it is incorrect to use these models to interpret or predict reflections from smooth surfaces, and only physical models are capable of describing the underlying reflection mechanism.
559|Generalization of the Lambertian Model and Implications for Machine Vision|Lambert&#039;s model for diffuse reflection is extensively used in computational vision. It is used explicitly by methods such as shape from shading and photometric stereo, and implicitly by methods such as binocular stereo and motion detection. For several realworld objects, the Lambertian model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the diffuse component. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, the brightness of a rough diffuse surface increases as the viewer approaches the source direction. A comprehensive model is developed that predicts reflectance from rough diffuse surfaces. The model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between points on the surface. Experiments have been conducted on real samples, such as, plaster, clay, sand, and cloth. All these surfaces demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in s...

562|Real-time Recognition with the entire Brodatz Texture Database|The Brodatz Album has become the de facto standard for evaluating texture algorithms, with hundreds of studies having been applied to small sets of its images. This paper compares two powerful recognition algorithms, principal components analysis and multiscale autoregressive models, by evaluating them on a 999image database derived from the entire Brodatz Album. The variety of homogeneous and non-homogeneous images studied is thus nearly an order of magnitude larger than has been compared before, giving one snapshot of the &#034;state of the art&#034; in real-time texture recognition.  1 Introduction  Image recognition applications are shifting rapidly from traditional areas of target recognition and satellite imagery to new areas in multi-media image/video analysis and retrieval of visual information. Many of the old applications can be typified by having a small number of &#034;classes&#034; of patterns, e.g., wheat, grass, water, and a large availability of training samples of each. In contrast, many ...
563|Visual Appearance of Matte Surfaces|All visual sensors, biological and artificial, are finite in resolution by necessity. This causes the effective reflectance of surfaces in a scene to vary with magnification. A reflectance model for matte surfaces is described that captures the effect of macroscopic surface undulations on image brightness. The model takes into account complex physical phenomena such as masking, shadowing and interreflections between points on the surface, and is shown to accurately predict the appearance of a wide range of natural surfaces. The implications of these results for human vision, machine vision, and computer graphics are demonstrated using both real and rendered images of three-dimensional objects. In particular, extreme surface roughness can cause objects to produce silhouette images devoid of shading, precluding visual perception of object shape.  Painters and sculptors are known to exploit their instinct for the interaction between light and materials[1, 2] to convey compelling shape cu...
564|Texture Segmentation and Shape in the Same Image|Uniformly textured surfaces in 3D scenes provide important cues for image understanding. Texture can be used for both segmentation and for 3D shape inference. Unfortunately, virtually all current algorithms are based on assumptions that make it impossible to do texture segmentation and shape-tom-texture in the same image. Texture segmentation algorithms rely on an absence of 3D effects that tend to distort the texture. Shape-from-texture algorithms depend on these effects, relying instead on the texture being already segmented. To really understand texture in images, texture segmentation and shape-from-texture must be viewed as a combined problem to be solved simultaneously. We present a solution to this problem with a region-growing algorithm that explicitly accounts for perspective distortions of other- wise uniform texture. We use the image spectrogram to com- pute local surface normals, which are in turn used to &#034;frontalize&#034;the texture. These frontalized texture patches are then subjected to a region-growing algorithm based on similarity in the local frequency domain and a minimum description length criteria. We show results of our algorithm on real texture images taken in the lab and outdoors.
565|Learning probabilistic relational models|A large portion of real-world data is stored in commercial relational database systems. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work only with &amp;quot;flat &amp;quot; data representations. Thus, to apply these methods, we are forced to convert our data into a flat form, thereby losing much of the relational structure present in our database. This paper builds on the recent work on probabilistic relational models (PRMs), and describes how to learn them from databases. PRMs allow the properties of an object to depend probabilistically both on other properties of that object and on properties of related objects. Although PRMs are significantly more expressive than standard models, such as Bayesian networks, we show how to extend well-known statistical methods for learning Bayesian networks to learn these models. We describe both parameter estimation and structure learning  the automatic induction of the dependency structure in a model. Moreover, we show how the learning procedure can exploit standard database retrieval techniques for efficient learning from large datasets. We present experimental results on both real and synthetic relational databases. 1

568|Loopy Belief Propagation for Approximate Inference: An Empirical Study|Recently, researchers have demonstrated that  &#034;loopy belief propagation&#034; --- the use of  Pearl&#039;s polytree algorithm in a Bayesian  network with loops --- can perform well  in the context of error-correcting codes.  The most dramatic instance of this is the  near Shannon-limit performance of &#034;Turbo  Codes&#034; --- codes whose decoding algorithm  is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a  chain-structured Bayesian network.  In this paper we ask: is there something special  about the error-correcting code context,  or does loopy propagation work as an approximate  inference scheme in a more general  setting? We compare the marginals computed  using loopy propagation to the exact  ones in four Bayesian network architectures,  including two real-world networks: ALARM  and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often  converge and when they do, they give a  good approximation to the correct marginals.  However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs  oscillated and had no obvious relationship  ...

571|Learning Bayesian network structure from massive datasets: the sparse candidate algorithm|Learning Bayesian networks is often cast as an optimization problem, where the computational task is to find a structure that maximizes a sta-tistically motivated score. By and large, existing learning tools address this optimization problem using standard heuristic search techniques. Since the search space is extremely large, such search procedures can spend most of the time examining candidates that are extremely unreasonable. This problem becomes critical when we deal with data sets that are large either in the number of in-stances, or the number of attributes. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that achieves faster learning by restricting the search space. This iterative algorithm restricts the par-ents of each variable to belong to a small sub-set of candidates. We then search for a network that satisfies these constraints. The learned net-work is then used for selecting better candidates for the next iteration. We evaluate this algorithm both on synthetic and real-life data. Our results show that it is significantly faster than alternative search procedures without loss of quality in the learned structures. 1

573|Learning Bayesian Networks is NP-Complete|Algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from data havetwo components: a scoring metric and a  search procedure. The scoring metric computes a score reflecting the goodness-of-fit of the structure  to the data. The search procedure tries to identify network structures with high scores. Heckerman  et al. (1995) introduce a Bayesian metric, called the BDe metric, that computes the relative posterior  probabilityofanetwork structure given data. In this paper, we show that the search problem of  identifying a Bayesian network---among those where each node has at most K parents---that has a  relative posterior probability greater than a given constant is NP-complete, when the BDe metric  is used.  12.1 
574|Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks|Bayesian networks provide a modeling language and associated inference algorithm for stochastic domains. They have been successfully applied in a variety of medium-scale applications. However, when faced with a large complex domain, the task of modeling using Bayesian networks begins to resemble the task of programming using logical circuits. In this paper, we describe an object-oriented Bayesian network (OOBN) language, which allows complex domains to be described in terms of inter-related objects. We use a Bayesian network fragment to describe the probabilistic relations between the attributes of an object. These attributes can themselves be objects, providing a natural framework for encoding part-of hierarchies. Classes are used to provide a reusable probabilistic model which can be applied to multiple similar objects. Classes also support inheritance of model fragments from a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language h...
575|Probabilistic Frame-Based Systems|Two of the most important threads of work in knowledge representation today are frame-based representation systems (FRS&#039;s) and Bayesian networks (BNs). FRS&#039;s provide an excellent representation for the organizational structure of large complex domains, but their applicability is limited because of their inability to deal with uncertainty and noise. BNs provide an intuitive and coherent probabilistic representation of our uncertainty, but are very limited in their ability to handle complex structured domains. In this paper, we provide a language that cleanly integrates these approaches, preserving the advantages of both. Our approach allows us to provide natural and compact definitions of probability models for a class, in a way that is local to the class frame. These models can be instantiated for any set of interconnected instances, resulting in a coherent probability distribution over the instance properties. Our language also allows us to represent important types of uncertainty tha...
576|A Bayesian approach to learning Bayesian networks with local structure|Recently several researchers have investigated techniques for using data to learn Bayesian networks containing compact representations for the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) stored at each node. The majority of this work has concentrated on using decision-tree representations for the CPDs. In addition, researchers typically apply non-Bayesian (or asymptotically Bayesian) scoring functions such as MDL to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of networks to the data. In this paper we investigate a Bayesian approach to learning Bayesian networks that contain the more general decision-graph representations of the CPDs. First, we describe how to evaluate the posterior probability that is, the Bayesian scoreof such a network, given a database of observed cases. Second, we describe various search spaces that can be used, in conjunction with a scoring function and a search procedure, to identify one or more high-scoring networks. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of the search spaces, using a greedy algorithm and a Bayesian scoring function. 1
577|Learning Belief Networks in the Presence of Missing Values and Hidden Variables|In recent years there has been a flurry of works on learning probabilistic belief networks. Current state of the art methods have been shown to be successful for two learning scenarios: learning both network structure and parameters from  complete data, and learning parameters for a fixed network from incomplete data---that is, in the presence of missing values or hidden variables. However, no method has yet been demonstrated to effectively learn network structure from incomplete data. In this paper, we propose a new method for learning network structure from incomplete data. This method is based on an extension of the  Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for model selection problems that performs search for the best structure inside the EM procedure. We prove the convergence of this algorithm, and adapt it for learning belief networks. We then describe how to learn networks in two scenarios: when the data contains missing values, and in the presence of hidden variables. We provide...
578|Unsupervised Learning from Dyadic Data|Dyadic data refers to a domain with two finite sets of objects in which observations are made for dyads, i.e., pairs with one element from either set. This includes event co-occurrences, histogram data, and single stimulus preference data as special cases. Dyadic data arises naturally in many applications ranging from computational linguistics and information retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, we present a systematic, domain-independent framework for unsupervised learning from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach covers different models with flat and hierarchical latent class structures and unifies probabilistic modeling and structure discovery. Mixture models provide both, a parsimonious yet flexible parameterization of probability distributions with good generalization performance on sparse data, as well as structural information about data-inherent grouping structure. We propose an annealed version of the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting which is empirically evaluated on a variety of data sets from different domains.
579|Answering Queries from Context-Sensitive Probabilistic Knowledge Bases|We define a language for representing context-sensitive probabilistic knowledge. A knowledge base consists of a set of universally quantified probability sentences that include context constraints, which allow inference to be focused on only the relevant portions of the probabilistic knowledge. We provide a declarative semantics for our language. We present a query answering procedure which takes a query Q and a set of evidence E and constructs a Bayesian network to compute P (QjE). The posterior probability is then computed using any of a number of Bayesian network inference algorithms. We use the declarative semantics to prove the query procedure sound and complete. We use concepts from logic programming to justify our approach.

582|Learning Probabilities for Noisy First-Order Rules|First-order logic is the traditional basis for knowledge representation languages. However, its applicability to many real-world tasks is limited by its inability to represent uncertainty. Bayesian belief networks, on the other hand, are inadequate for complex KR tasks due to the limited expressivity of the underlying (propositional) language. The need to incorporate uncertainty into an expressive language has led to a resurgence of work on first-order probabilistic logic. This paper addresses one of the main objections to the incorporation of probabilities into the language: &#034;Where do the numbers come from?&#034; We present an approach that takes a knowledge base in an expressive rule-based first-order language, and learns the probabilistic parameters associated with those rules from data cases. Our approach, which is based on algorithms for learning in traditional Bayesian networks, can handle data cases where many of the relevant aspects of the situation are unobserved. It is also capabl...

The study, conducted at the request of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, evaluates the technical and public policy implications of widespread use of AI technologies by the Federal government for fraud detection. Its conclusions are relevant tomanyother uses of AI technologies for fraud detection in both the public and private sectors.
584|PRL: A probabilistic relational language|In this paper, we describe the syntax and semantics for a probabilistic relational language (PRL). PRL is a recasting of recent work in Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) into a logic programming framework. We show how to represent varying degrees of complexity in the semantics including attribute uncertainty, structural uncertainty and identity uncertainty. Our approach is similar in spirit to the work in Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), and Logical Bayesian Networks (LBNs). However, surprisingly, there are still some important differences in the resulting formalism; for example, we introduce a general notion of aggregates based on the PRM approaches. One of our contributions is that we show how to support richer forms of structural uncertainty in a probabilistic logical language than have been previously described. Our goal in this work is to present a unifying framework that supports all of the types of relational uncertainty yet is based on logic programming formalisms. We also believe that it facilitates understanding the relationship between the frame-based approaches and alternate logic programming approaches, and allows greater
585|Privacy Preserving Data Mining|In this paper we address the issue of privacy preserving data mining. Specifically, we consider a  scenario in which two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on  the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. Our work is motivated  by the need to both protect privileged information and enable its use for research or other purposes. The
586|Public-key cryptosystems based on composite degree residuosity classes| This paper investigates a novel computational problem, namely the Composite Residuosity Class Problem, and its applications to public-key cryptography. We propose a new trapdoor mechanism and derive from this technique three encryption schemes: a trapdoor permutation and two homomorphic probabilistic encryption schemes computationally comparable to RSA. Our cryptosystems, based on usual modular arithmetics, are provably secure under appropriate assumptions in the standard model.  
587|A randomized protocol for signing contracts|Two parties, A and B, want to sign a contract C over a communication network. To do so, they must simultaneously exchange their commitments to C. Since simultaneous exchange is usually impossible in practice, protocols are needed to approximate simultaneity by exchanging partial commitments in piece by piece manner. During such a protocol, one party or another may have a slight advantage; a fair protocol keeps this advantage within acceptable limits. We present a new protocol that is fair in the sense that, at any stage in its execution, the conditional probability that one party cannot commit both parties to the contract given that the other party can, is close to zero. This is true even if A and B have vastly different computing powers, and is proved under very weak cryptographic assumptions. Our protocol has the following additional properties: 4 during the procedure the parties exchange probadilistic options for committing both parties to the contract; the protocol never terminates in an asymmetric situation where party A knows that party B is committed to the contract while he is not; the protocol makes use of a weak form of a third party (judge). If both A and B are honest, the judge will never be called upon. Otherwise, the judge rules by performing a simple computation. No bookkeeping is required of the judge. 
588|Multiparty unconditionally secure protocols|Under the assumption that each pair of participants em communieatc secretly, we show that any reasonable multiparty protwol can be achieved if at least Q of the Participants am honest. The secrecy achieved is unconditional, It does not rely on any assumption about computational intractability. 1.
589|Security and Composition of Multi-party Cryptographic Protocols|We present general definitions of security for multi-party cryptographic protocols, with focus  on the task of evaluating a probabilistic function of the parties&#039; inputs. We show that, with  respect to these definitions, security is preserved under a natural composition operation.  The definitions follow the general paradigm of known definitions; yet some substantial modifications  and simplifications are introduced. The composition operation is the natural `subroutine  substitution&#039; operation, formalized by Micali and Rogaway.  We consider several standard settings for multi-party protocols, including the cases of eavesdropping,  Byzantine, non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries, as well as the information-theoretic  and the computational models. In particular, in the computational model we provide the first  definition of security of protocols that is shown to be preserved under composition.  
590|Efficient generation of shared RSA keys|We describe efficient techniques for a number of parties to jointly generate an RSA key. At the end of the protocol an RSA modulus N = pq is publicly known. None of the parties know the factorization of N. In addition a public encryption exponent is publicly known and each party holds a share of the private exponent that enables threshold decryption. Our protocols are efficient in computation and communication. All results are presented in the honest but curious settings (passive adversary).

592|Two Party RSA Key Generation|. We present a protocol for two parties to generate an RSA  key in a distributed manner. At the end of the protocol the public key: a  modulus N = PQ, and an encryption exponent e are known to both parties.  Individually, neither party obtains information about the decryption  key d and the prime factors of N : P and Q. However, d is shared among  the parties so that threshold decryption is possible.  1 Introduction  We show how two parties can jointly generate RSA public and private keys. Following the execution of our protocol each party learns the public key: N = PQ and e, but does not know the factorization of N or the decryption exponent d. The exponent d is shared among the two players in such a way that joint decryption of cipher-texts is possible.  Generation of RSA keys in a private, distributed manner figures prominently in several cryptographic protocols. An example is threshold cryptography, see [12] for a survey. In a threshold RSA signature scheme there are k parties who ...
593|Oblivious Polynomial Evaluation|Oblivious polynomial evaluation is a protocol involving two parties, a sender whose input is a polynomial P, and a receiver whose input is a value a. At the end of the protocol the receiver learns P (a) and the sender learns nothing. We describe efficient constructions for this protocol, which are based on new intractability assumptions that are closely related to noisy polynomial reconstruction. Oblivious polynomial evaluation can be used as a primitive in many applications. We describe several such applications, including protocols for private comparison of data, for mutually authenticated key exchange based on (possibly weak) passwords, and for anonymous coupons. 1

595|Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints|This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from  images, which can be used to perform reliable matching between different images  of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation,  and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range  of affine distortion, addition of noise, change in 3D viewpoint, and change in  illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature  can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of  features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using  these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching  individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast  nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters  belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through leastsquares  solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition  can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near  real-time performance.
596|Approximate Nearest Neighbors: Towards Removing the Curse of Dimensionality|The nearest neighbor problem is the following: Given a set of n points P = fp 1 ; : : : ; png in  some metric space X, preprocess P so as to efficiently answer queries which require finding the  point in P closest to a query point q 2 X. We focus on the particularly interesting case of the  d-dimensional Euclidean space where X = !  d  under some l p norm. Despite decades of effort,  the current solutions are far from satisfactory; in fact, for large d, in theory or in practice, they  provide little improvement over the brute-force algorithm which compares the query point to  each data point. Of late, there has been some interest in the approximate nearest neighbors  problem, which is: Find a point p 2 P that is an ffl-approximate nearest neighbor of the query  q in that for all p  0  2 P , d(p; q)  (1 + ffl)d(p  0  ; q).  We present two algorithmic results for the approximate version that significantly improve the  known bounds: (a) preprocessing cost polynomial in n and d, and a trul...
597|Robust wide baseline stereo from maximally stable extremal regions|The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing correspon-dences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints is studied. A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly de-sirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of im-age intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast de-tection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspon-dences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from ex-tremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5×), illumi-nation conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion, locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test prob-lems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corre-sponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained. 1
598|Evaluation of Interest Point Detectors| Many different low-level feature detectors exist and it is widely agreed that the evaluation of detectors is important. In this paper we introduce two evaluation criteria for interest points: repeatability rate and information content. Repeatability rate evaluates the geometric stability under different transformations. Information content measures the distinctiveness of features. Different interest point detectors are compared using these two criteria. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well.
599|A comparison of affine region detectors|The paper gives a snapshot of the state of the art in affine covariant region detectors, and compares their performance on a set of test images under varying imaging conditions. Six types of detectors are included: detectors based on affine normalization around Harris [24, 34] and Hessian points [24], as proposed by Mikolajczyk and Schmid and by Schaffalitzky and Zisserman; a detector of maximally stable extremal regions, proposed by Matas et al. [21]; an edge-based region detector [45] and a detector based on intensity extrema [47], proposed by Tuytelaars and Van Gool; and a detector of salient regions, proposed by Kadir, Zisserman and Brady [12]. The performance is measured against changes in viewpoint, scale, illumination, defocus and image compression. The objective of this paper is also to establish a reference test set of images and performance software, so that future detectors can be evaluated in the same framework. 1
600|Reliable Feature Matching Across Widely Separated Views|In this paper we present a robust method for automatically matching features in images corresponding to the same physical point on an object seen from two arbitrary viewpoints. Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method - our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches.
601|Randomized trees for realtime keypoint recognition|In earlier work, we proposed treating wide baseline matching of feature points as a classification problem, in which each class corresponds to the set of all possible views of such a point. We used a K-mean plus Nearest Neighbor classifier to validate our approach, mostly because it was simple to implement. It has proved effective but still too slow for real-time use. In this paper, we advocate instead the use of randomized trees as the classification technique. It is both fast enough for real-time performance and more robust. It also gives us a principled way not only to match keypoints but to select during a training phase those that are the most recognizable ones. This results in a real-time system able to detect and position in 3D planar, non-planar, and even deformable objects. It is robust to illuminations changes, scale changes and occlusions. 1.
602|3D Object modeling and recognition using local affine-invariant image descriptors and multi-view spatial constraints|Abstract. This article introduces a novel representation for three-dimensional (3D) objects in terms of local affine-invariant descriptors of their images and the spatial relationships between the corresponding surface patches. Geometric constraints associated with different views of the same patches under affine projection are combined with a normalized representation of their appearance to guide matching and reconstruction, allowing the acquisition of true 3D affine and Euclidean models from multiple unregistered images, as well as their recognition in photographs taken from arbitrary viewpoints. The proposed approach does not require a separate segmentation stage, and it is applicable to highly cluttered scenes. Modeling and recognition results are presented.
603|Shape-adapted smoothing in estimation of 3-D depth cues from affine distortions of local 2-D brightness structure|Rotationally symmetric operations in the image domain may give rise to shape distortions. This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under a ne transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping. 
604|Evaluation of Local Detectors on Non-Planar Scenes|This paper presents for the first time a method to evaluate the performance of local detectors under viewpoint changes on complex, realistic, and practically relevant scenes. The main contribution is a method which allows the automatic verification of detected corresponding points and regions for non-planar scenes. Using this method the performances of 10 di#erent local detectors were evaluated in a large scale experiment. A ranking of the di#erent detectors has been established based on this evaluation.
605|Approximating discrete probability distributions with dependence trees|A method is presented to approximate optimally an n-dimensional discrete probability distribution by a product of second-order distributions, or the distribution of the first-order tree dependence. The problem is to find an optimum set of n-1 first order dependence relationship among the n variables. It is shown that the procedure derived in this paper yields an approximation of a minimum difference in information. It is further shown that when this procedure is applied to empirical observations from an unknown distribution of tree dependence, the procedure is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the distribution.
606|Fusion, Propagation, and Structuring in Belief Networks|Belief networks are directed acyclic graphs in which the nodes represent propositions (or variables), the arcs signify direct dependencies between the linked propositions, and the strengths of these dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities. A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called &#034;hidden causes. &#034; It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves.  
607|Connectionist Learning Procedures|A major goal of research on networks of neuron-like processing units is to discover efficient learning procedures that allow these networks to construct complex internal representations of their environment. The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and their generalization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.

This paper surveys the potential for addressing problems in representation, inference, knowledge engineering, and explanation within the decision-theoretic framework. Recent analyses of the restrictions of several traditional AI reasoning techniques, coupled with the development of more tractable and expressive decisiontheoretic representation and inference strategies, have stimulated renewed interest in decision theory and decision analysis. We describe early experience with simple probabilistic schemes for automated reasoning, review the dominant expert-system paradigm, and survey some recent research at the crossroads of AI and decision science. In particular, we present the belief network and influence diagram representations. Finally, we discuss issues that have not been studied in detail within the expert-systems sett...
611|Constructor: A system for the induction of probabilistic models|The probabilistic network technology is a knowledgebased technique which focuses on reasoning under uncertainty. Because of its well defined semantics and solid theoretical foundations, the technology is finding increasing application in fields such as medical diagnosis, machine vision, military situation assessment, petroleum exploration, and information retrieval. However, like other knowledge-based techniques, acquiring the qualitative and quantitative information needed to build these networks can be highly labor-intensive. CONSTRUCTQR integrates techniques and concepts from probabilistic networks, artificial intelligence, and statistics in order to induce Markov networks (i.e., undirected probabilistic networks). The resulting networks are useful both qualitatively for concept organization and quantitatively for the assessment of new data. The primary goal of CONSTRUCTOR is to find qualitative structure from data. CONSTRUCTOR finds structure by first, modeling each feature in a data set as a node in a Markov network and secondly, by finding the neighbors of each node in the network. In Markov networks, the neighbors of a node have the property of being the smallest set of nodes which shield  the node from being affected by other nodes in the graph. This property is used in a heuristic search to identify each nodes neighbors. The traditional x2 test for independence is used to test if a set of nodes shield  another node. Cross-validation is used to estimate the quality of alternative structures.
612|Advances in probabilistic reasoning|This paper discuses multiple Bayesian networks representation paradigms for encoding asymmetric independence assertions. We offer three contributions: (1) an inference mechanism that makes explicit use of asymmetric independence to speed up computations, (2) a simplified definition of similarity networks and extensions of their theory, and (3) a generalized representation scheme that encodes more types of asymmetric independence assertions than do similarity networks. 1

614|Latent variables, causal models and overidentifying constraints|When is a statistical dependency between two variables best explained by the supposition that one of these variables causes the other, as opposed to the supposition that there is a (possibly unmeasured) common cause acting on both variables? In this paper, we describe an approach towards model specification developed more fully in our book Discovering Cuud Structure, and illustrate its application to the aforementioned question. Briefly, the approach is to determine constraints satisfied by the variance-covariance matrix of a sample, and then to conduct a quasi-automated search for the causal specifications that will best explain those constraints, 1.

616|Social Information Filtering: Algorithms for Automating &#034;Word of Mouth&#034;|This paper describes a technique for making personalized recommendations from any type of database to a user based on similarities between the interest profile of that user and those of other users. In particular, we discuss the implementation of a networked system called Ringo, which makes personalized recommendations for music albums and artists. Ringo&#039;s database of users and artists grows dynamically as more people use the system and enter more information. Four different algorithms for making recommendations by using social information filtering were tested and compared. We present quantitative and qualitative results obtained from the use of Ringo by more than 2000 people.
617|Indexing by latent semantic analysis|A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (semantic structure) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 or-thogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are re-turned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.
618|GroupLens: An Open Architecture for Collaborative Filtering of Netnews|Collaborative filters help people make choices based on the opinions of other people. GroupLens is a system for collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find articles they will like in the huge stream of available articles. News reader clients display predicted scores and make it easy for users to rate articles after they read them. Rating servers, called Better Bit Bureaus, gather and disseminate the ratings. The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire architecture is open: alternative software for news clients and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed independently and can interoperate with the components we have developed.
619|Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry|predicated on the belief that information filtering can be more effective when humans are involved in the filtering process. Tapestry was designed to support both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, which entails people collaborating to help each other perform filtering by recording their reactions to documents they read. The reactions are called annotations; they can be accessed by other peoples filters. Tapestry is intended to handle any incoming stream of electronic documents and serves both as a mail filter and repository; its components are the indexer, document store, annotation store, filterer, little box, remailer, appraiser and reader/browser. Tapestrys client/server architecture, its various components, and the Tapestry query language are described.
620|Social information filtering for music recommendation|Abstract Filters which select items for individual users based upon content suffer from several limitations. The items being filtered must be amenable to parsing by a computer. Furthermore, Content-Based Filters possess no inherent method for serendipitous exploration of the information space.
621|Mining the Network Value of Customers|One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected pro t from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected pro t from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer&#039;s network value: the expected pro t from sales to other customers she may inuence to buy, the customers those may inuence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random eld. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative ltering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers|also known as viral marketing|can be extremely eective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.

622|The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine|In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/

To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.

Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.
623|Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment|The network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have effective means for understanding it. We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of authoritative  information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of hub pages  that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.
624|Enhanced Hypertext Categorization Using Hyperlinks|A major challenge in indexing unstructured hypertext databases is to automatically extract meta-data that enables structured search using topic taxonomies, circumvents keyword ambiguity, and improves the quality of search and profile-based routing and filtering. Therefore, an accurate classifier is an essential component of a hypertext database. Hyperlinks pose new problems not addressed in the extensive text classification literature. Links clearly contain highquality semantic clues that are lost upon a purely termbased classifier, but exploiting link information is non-trivial because it is noisy. Naive use of terms in the link neighborhood of a document can even degrade accuracy. Our contribution is to propose robust statistical models and a  relaxation labeling technique for better classification by exploiting link information in a small neighborhood around documents. Our technique also adapts gracefully to the fraction of neighboring documents having known topics. We experimented ...
625|Scale-free characteristics of random networks: The topology of the world-wide web|The world-wide web forms a large directed graph, whose vertices are documents and edges are links pointing from one document to another. Here we demonstrate that despite its apparent random character, the topology of this graph has a number of universal scale-free characteristics. We introduce a model that leads to a scale-free network, capturing in a minimal fashion the self-organization processes governing the world-wide web. 
627|Data Mining for Direct Marketing: Problems and Solutions|Direct marketing is a process of identifying likely buyers of certain products and promoting the products accordingly. It is increasingly used by banks, insurance companies, and the retail industry. Data mining can provide an effective tool for direct marketing. During data mining, several specific problems arise. For example, the class distribution is extremely imbalanced (the response rate is about 1~), the predictive accuracy is no longer suitable for evaluating learning methods, and the number of examples can be too large. In this paper, we discuss methods of coping with these problems based on our experience on direct-marketing projects using data mining. 1

630|A decision theoretic approach to targeted advertising|A simple advertising strategy that can be used to help increase sales of a product is to mail out special o ers to selected potential customers. Because there is a cost associated with sending each o er, the optimal mailing strategy depends on both the bene t obtained from a purchase and how the o er a ects the buying behavior of the customers. In this paper, we describe two methods for partitioning the potential customers into groups, and show howto perform a simple cost-bene t analysis to decide which, if any, of the groups should be targeted. In particular, weconsidertwodecision-tree learning algorithms. The rst is an \o the shelf &#034; algorithm used to model the probability that groups of customers will buy the product. The second is a new algorithm that is similar to the rst, except that for each group, it explicitly models the probability of purchase under the two mailing scenarios: (1) the mail is sent tomembers of that group and (2) the mail is not sent to members of that group. Using data from a real-world advertising experiment, we compare the algorithms to each other and to a naive mail-to-all strategy. 1
631|The Skyline Operator|We propose to extend database systems by a Skyline operation. This operation filters out a set of interesting points from a potentially large set of data points. A point is interesting if it is not dominated by any other point. For example, a hotel might be interesting for somebody traveling to Nassau if no other hotel is both cheaper and closer to the beach. We show how SQL can be extended to pose Skyline queries, present and evaluate alternative algorithms to implement the Skyline operation, and show how this operation can be combined with other database operations (e.g., join and Top N).
632|Query evaluation techniques for large databases|Database management systems will continue to manage large data volumes. Thus, efficient algorithms for accessing and manipulating large sets and sequences will be required to provide acceptable performance. The advent of object-oriented and extensible database systems will not solve this problem. On the contrary, modern data models exacerbate it: In order to manipulate large sets of complex objects as efficiently as todays database systems manipulate simple records, query processing algorithms and software will become more complex, and a solid understanding of algorithm and architectural issues is essential for the designer of database management software. This survey provides a foundation for the design and implementation of query execution facilities in new database management systems. It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and post-relational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains.
633|Nearest Neighbor Queries|A frequently encountered type of query in Geographic Information Systems is to find the k nearest neighbor objects to a given point in space. Processing such queries requires substantially different search algorithms than those for location or range queries. In this paper we present an efficient branch-and-bound R-tree traversal algorithm to find the nearest neighbor object to a point, and then generalize it to finding the k nearest neighbors. We also discuss metrics for an optimistic and a pessimistic search ordering strategy as well as for pruning. Finally, we present the results of several experiments obtained using the implementation of our algorithm and examine the behavior of the metrics and the scalability of the algorithm. 
634|Combining fuzzy information from multiple systems (Extended Abstract)  (1996) |In a traditional database system, the result of a query is a set of values (those values that satisfy the query). In other data servers, such as a system with queries baaed on image content, or many text retrieval systems, the result of a query is a sorted list. For example, in the case of a system with queries based on image content, the query might aak for objects that are a particular shade of red, and the result of the query would be a sorted list of objects in the database, sorted by how well the color of the object matches that given in the query. A multimedia system must somehow synthesize both types of queries (those whose result is a set, and those whose result is a sorted list) in a consistent manner. In this paper we discuss the solution adopted by Garlic, a multimedia information system being developed at

636|Reducing the braking distance of an SQL query engine|In a recent paper, we proposed adding a STOP AFTER clause to SQL to permit the cardinality of a query result to be explicitly limited by query writers and query tools. We demonstrated the usefulness of having this clause, showed how to extend a traditional cost-based query optimizer to accommodate it, and demonstrated via DB2-based simulations that large performance gains are possible when STOP AFTER queries are explicitly supported by the database engine. In this paper, we present several new strategies for efficiently processing STOP AFTER queries. These strategies, based largely on the use of range partitioning techniques, offer significant additional savings for handling STOP AFTER queries that yield sizeable result sets. We describe classes of queries where such savings would indeed arise and present experimental measurements that show the benefits and tradeoffs associated with the new processing strategies. 1
637|Duplicate record elimination in large data files |The issue of duplicate elimination for large data files in which many occurrences of the same record may appear is addressed. A comprehensive cost analysis of the duplicate elimination operation is presented. This analysis is based on a combinatorial model developed for estimating the size of intermediate runs produced by a modified merge-sort procedure. The performance of this modified merge-sort procedure is demonstrated to be significantly superior to the standard duplicate elimination technique of sorting followed by a sequential pass to locate duplicate records. The results can also be used to provide critical input to a query optimizer in a relational database system.
638|SEEKing the Truth about Ad Hoc Join Costs|In this paper, we reexamine the results of prior work on methods for computing ad hoc joins. We  develop a detailed cost model for predicting join algorithm performance, and we use the model to develop  cost formulas for the major ad hoc join methods found in the relational database literature. We show  that various pieces of &#034;common wisdom&#034; about join algorithm performance fail to hold up when analyzed  carefully, and we use our detailed cost model to derive optimal buffer allocation schemes for each of  the join methods examined here. We show that optimizing their buffer allocations can lead to large  performance improvements, e.g., as much as a 400% improvement in some cases. We also validate our  cost model&#039;s predictions by measuring an actual implementation of each join algorithm considered. The  results of this work should be directly useful to implementors of relational query optimizers and query  processing systems.  1 Introduction  The join of two sets of tuples is a fundament...
639|Grouping and Duplicate Elimination: Benefits of Early Aggregation|Early aggregation is a technique for speeding up the processing of GROUP BY  queries by reducing the amount of intermediate data transferred between main memory and disk. It can also be applied to duplicate elimination because duplicate elimination is equivalent to grouping with no aggregation functions. This paper describes six different algorithms for grouping and aggregation, shows how to incorporate early aggregation in each of them, and analyzes the resulting reduction in intermediate data. In addition to the grouping algorithm used, the reduction depends on several factors: the number of groups, the skew in group size distribution, the input size, and the amount of main memory available. All six algorithms considered benefit from early aggregation with grouping by hash partitioning producing the least amount of intermediate data. If the group size distribution is skewed, the overall reduction can be very significant, even with a modest amount of additional main memory. 
640|Query Evaluation in CROQUE  -- Calculus and Algebra Coincide  | With the substantial change of declarative query languages from plain SQL to the so-called &#034;object SQLs&#034;, in particular OQL, there has surprisingly been not much change in the way problems of query representation and optimization for such languages are tackled. We identify some of the difficulties pure algebraic approaches experience when facing object models and the operations defined for them. Calculus-style formalisms suite this challenge better, but are said not to be efficiently implementable in the database context. This paper proposes a hybrid query representation and optimization approach, combining the strengths of a many-sorted query algebra and the monoid comprehension calculus. We show that efficient execution plans beyond nested-loop processing can be derived -- not only for oe-ß-1 queries -- in such a framework. The translation process accounts for queries manipulating bulk-typed values by employing various join methods of the database engine, as well as queries that us...
641|Mining Frequent Patterns  without Candidate Generation: A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach|Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist a large number of patterns and/or long patterns. In this study,  we propose a novel
frequent-pattern tree
(FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree
structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-
based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth.
Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a condensed,
smaller data structure, FP-tree which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts
a pattern-fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a
partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for
mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance
study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns,
and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported
new frequent-pattern mining methods
642|Discovering Frequent Closed Itemsets for Association Rules|In this paper, we address the problem of finding frequent itemsets in a database. Using the closed itemset lattice framework, we show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of finding frequent closed itemsets. Based on this statement, we can construct efficient data mining algorithms by limiting the search space to the closed itemset lattice rather than the subset lattice. Moreover, we show that the set of all frequent closed itemsets suffices to determine a reduced set of association rules, thus addressing another important data mining problem: limiting the number of rules produced without information loss. We propose a new algorithm, called A-Close, using a closure mechanism to find frequent closed itemsets. We realized experiments to compare our approach to the commonly used frequent itemset search approach. Those experiments showed that our approach is very valuable for dense and/or correlated data that represent an important part of existing databases.
643|Discovery of frequent episodes in event sequences|Abstract. Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of users or systems can be collected in several domains. An episode is a collection of events that occur relatively close to each other in a given partial order. We consider the problem of discovering frequently occurring episodes in a sequence. Once such episodes are known, one can produce rules for describing or predicting the behavior of the sequence. We give efficient algorithms for the discovery of all frequent episodes from a given class of episodes, and present detailed experimental results. The methods are in use in telecommunication alarm management. Keywords: event sequences, frequent episodes, sequence analysis 1.
644|Efficient Mining of Emerging Patterns: Discovering Trends and Differences|We introduce a new kind of patterns, called emerging patterns (EPs), for knowledge discovery from databases. EPs are defined as itemsets whose supports increase significantly  from one dataset to another. EPs can capture emerging trends in timestamped databases, or useful contrasts between data classes. EPs have been proven useful: we have used them to build very powerful classifiers, which are more accurate than C4.5 and CBA, for many datasets. We believe that EPs with low to medium support, such as 1%-- 20%, can give useful new insights and guidance to experts, in even &#034;well understood&#034; applications.  The efficient mining of EPs is a challenging problem, since (i) the Apriori property no longer holds for EPs, and (ii) there are usually too many candidates for high dimensional databases or for small support thresholds such as 0.5%. Naive algorithms are too costly. To solve this problem, (a) we promote the description of large collections of itemsets using their concise borders (the pa...
645|PrefixSpan: Mining Sequential Patterns Efficiently by Prefix-Projected Pattern Growth|Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. It is challenging since one may need to examine a combinatorially explosive number of possible subsequence patterns. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods follow the methodology of    which may substantially reduce the number of combinations to be examined. However,   still encounters problems when a sequence database is large and/or when sequential patterns to be mined are numerous and/or long.
646|CHARM: An efficient algorithm for closed itemset mining|The set of frequent closed itemsets uniquely determines the exact frequency of all itemsets, yet it can be orders of magnitude smaller than the set of all frequent itemsets. In this paper we present CHARM, an efficient algorithm for mining all frequent closed itemsets. It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels. It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally it uses a fast hash-based approach to remove any non-closed sets found during computation. An extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic databases shows that CHARM significantly outperforms previous methods. It is also linearly scalable in the number of transactions.
647|Exploratory Mining and Pruning Optimizations of Constrained Associations Rules|From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge, the present-day model of mining association rules suffers from the following serious shortcom- ings: (i) lack of user exploration and control, (ii) lack of focus, and (iii) rigid notion of relationships. In effect, this model functions as a black-box, admitting little user interaction in between. We propose, in this paper, an architecture that opens up the black-box, and supports constraintbased, human-centered exploratory mining of associations. The foundation of this architecture is a rich set of con- straint constructs, including domain, class, and $QL-style aggregate constraints, which enable users to clearly specify what associations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means of specifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined association.
648|CLOSET: An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Frequent Closed Itemsets|Association mining may often derive an undesirably large set of frequent itemsets and association rules. Recent studies have proposed an interesting alternative: mining frequent closed itemsets and their corresponding rules, which has the same power as association mining but substantially reduces the number of rules to be presented. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, CLOSET, for mining closed itemsets, with the development of three techniques: (1) applying a compressed, frequent pattern tree FP-tree structure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation, (2) developing a single prefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly, and (3) exploring a partition-based projection mechanism for scalable mining in large databases. Our performance study shows that CLOSET is efficient and scalable over large databases, and is faster than the previously proposed methods. 1 Introduction It has been well recognized that frequent pattern minin...
649|Efficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules|Association rules are statements of the form &#034;for 90 % of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W , then it has 1 also in column B&#034;. Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami introduced the problem of mining association rules from large collections of data, and gave a method based on successive passes over the database. We give an improved algorithm for the problem. The method is based on careful combinatorial analysis of the information obtained in previous passes; this makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary candidate rules. Experiments on a university course enrollment database indicate that the method outperforms the previous one by a factor of 5. We also show that sampling is in general a very efficient way of finding such rules. Keywords: association rules, covering sets, algorithms, sampling. 1 Introduction Data mining (database mining, knowledge discovery in databases) has recently been recognized as a promising new field in the intersection of databa...
650|A tree projection algorithm for generation of frequent itemsets|In this paper we propose algorithms for generation of frequent itemsets by successive construction of the nodes of a lexicographic tree of itemsets. We discuss di erent strategies in generation and traversal of the lexicographic tree such as breadth- rst search, depth- rst search or a combination of the two. These techniques provide di erent trade-o s in terms of the I/O, memory and computational time requirements. We use the hierarchical structure of the lexicographic tree to successively project transactions at each node of the lexicographic tree, and use matrix counting on this reduced set of transactions for nding frequent itemsets. We tested our algorithm on both real and synthetic data. We provide an implementation of the tree projection method which is up to one order of magnitude faster than other recent techniques in the literature. The algorithm has a well structured data access pattern which provides data locality and reuse of data for multiple levels of the cache. We also discuss methods for parallelization of the
651|Efficient mining of partial periodic patterns in time series database|Partial periodicity search, i.e., search for partial periodic patterns in time-series databases, is an interesting data mining problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly consider finding full periodic patterns, where every point in time contributes (precisely or approximately) to the periodicity. However, partial periodicity is very common in practice since it is more likely that only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. We present several algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns, by exploring some interesting properties related to partial periodicity, such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property, and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hit set property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of all frequent patterns from a relatively small subset of patterns existing in the time series. We show that mining partial periodicity needs only two scans over the time series database, even for mining multiple periods. The performance study shows our proposed methods are very efficient in mining long periodic patterns.
652|Clustering association rules|We consider the problem of clustering two-dimensional as-sociation rules in large databases. We present a geometric-based algorithm, BitOp, for performing the clustering, em-bedded within an association rule clustering system, ARCS. Association rule clustering is useful when the user desires to segment the data. We measure the quality of the segment-ation generated by ARCS using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle of encoding the clusters on several databases including noise and errors. Scale-up experiments show that ARCS, using the BitOp algorithm, scales linearly with the amount of data. 1
653|Integrating association rule mining with relational database systems: Alternatives and implications |Abstract. Data mining on large data warehouses is becoming increasingly important. In support of this trend, we consider a spectrum of architectural alternatives for coupling mining with database systems. These alternatives include: loose-coupling through a SQL cursor interface; encapsulation of a mining algorithm in a stored procedure; caching the data to a file system on-the-fly and mining; tight-coupling using primarily user-defined functions; and SQL implementations for processing in the DBMS. We comprehensively study the option of expressing the mining algorithm in the form of SQL queries using Association rule mining as a case in point. We consider four options in SQL-92 and six options in SQL enhanced with object-relational extensions (SQL-OR). Our evaluation of the different architectural alternatives shows that from a performance perspective, the Cache option is superior, although the performance of the SQL-OR option is within a factor of two. Both the Cache and the SQL-OR approaches incur a higher storage penalty than the loose-coupling approach which performance-wise is a factor of 3 to 4 worse than Cache. The SQL-92 implementations were too slow to qualify as a competitive option. We also compare these alternatives on the basis of qualitative factors like automatic parallelization, development ease, portability and inter-operability. As a byproduct of this study, we identify some primitives for native support in database systems for decision-support applications. Keywords: mining system architecture, association rule mining, database mining, mining algorithms in SQL
654|Mining Frequent Itemsets with Convertible Constraints|Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based mining paradigm in the context of frequent itemsets, associations, correlations, sequential patterns, and many other interesting patterns in large databases. In this paper, we study constraints which cannot be handled with existing theory and techniques. For example,, ,  ( can contain items of arbitrary values) &#034;!$ # %&#039;&amp;) ( , are customarily regarded as tough  constraints in that they cannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraints and systematically analyze, classify, and characterize this class. We also develop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recently developed FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed experiments show the effectiveness of the techniques developed. 1.

However, the previously proposed methods still encounter some performance bottlenecks when mining databases with different data characteristics, such as dense vs. sparse, long vs. short patterns, memory-based vs. disk-based, etc.
657|Efficient Mining of Constrained Correlated Sets|In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently computing correlated itemsets satisfying given constraints. We call them valid correlated itemsets. It turns out constraints can have subtle interactions with correlated itemsets, depending on their underlying properties. We show that in general the set of minimal valid correlated itemsets does not coincide with that of minimal correlated itemsets that are valid, and characterize classes of constraints for which these sets coincide. We delineate the meaning of these two spaces and give algorithms for computing them. We also give an analytical evaluation of their performance and validate our analysis with a detailed experimental evaluation.  
658|Face recognition: features versus templates|Abstract-Over the last 20 years, several different techniques have been proposed for computer recognition of human faces. The purpose of this paper is to compare two simple but general strategies on a common database (frontal images of faces of 47 people: 26 males and 21 females, four images per person). We have developed and implemented two new algorithms; the first one is based on the computation of a set of geometrical features, such as nose width and length, mouth position, and chin shape, and the second one is based on almost-grey-level template matching. The results obtained on the testing sets (about 90 % correct recognition using geometrical features and perfect recognition using template matching) favor our implementation of the template-matching approach.

659|A Theory of Networks for Approximation and Learning|Learning an input-output mapping from a set of examples, of the type that many  neural networks have been constructed to perform, can be regarded as synthesizing  an approximation of a multi-dimensional function, that is solving the problem of hypersurface  reconstruction. From this point of view, this form of learning is closely  related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization  theory. This paper considers the problems of an exact representation and, in  more detail, of the approximation of linear and nonlinear mappings in terms of simpler  functions of fewer variables. Kolmogorov&#039;s theorem concerning the representation  of functions of several variables in terms of functions of one variable turns out to be  almost irrelevant in the context of networks for learning. Wedevelop a theoretical  framework for approximation based on regularization techniques that leads to a class  of three-layer networks that we call Generalized Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), since  they are mathematically related to the well-known Radial Basis Functions, mainly used  for strict interpolation tasks. GRBF networks are not only equivalent to generalized  splines, but are also closely related to pattern recognition methods suchasParzen  windows and potential functions and to several neural network algorithms, suchas  Kanerva&#039;s associative memory,backpropagation and Kohonen&#039;s topology preserving  map. They also haveaninteresting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are  synthesized and optimally combined during the learning stage. The paper introduces  several extensions and applications of the technique and discusses intriguing analogies  with neurobiological data.
660|HyperBF Networks for real object recognition|Even if represented in a way which is invariant to illumination conditions, a 3D object gives rise to an infinite number of 2D views, depending on its pose. It has been recently shown ([6]) that it is possible to synthesize a module that can recognize a specific 3D object from any viewpoint, by using a new technique of learning from examples, which are, in this case, a small set of 2D views of the object. In this paper we extend the technique, a) to deal with real objects (isolated paper clips) that suffer from noise and occlusions and b) to exploit negative examples during the learning phase. We also compare different versions of the multilayer networks corresponding to our technique among themselves and with a standard Nearest Neighbor classifier. The simplest version, which is a Radial Basis Functions network, performs less well than a Nearest Neighbor classifier. The more powerful versions, trained with positive and negative examples, perform significantly better. Our results, whic...
661|A high-performance, portable implementation of the MPI message passing interface standard|MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a specification for a standard library for message passing that was defined by the MPI Forum, a broadly based group of parallel computer vendors, library writers, and applications specialists. Multiple implementations of MPI have been developed. In this paper, we describe MPICH, unique among existing implementations in its design goal of combining portability with high performance. We document its portability and performance and describe the architecture by which these features are simultaneously achieved. We also discuss the set of tools that accompany the free distribution of MPICH, which constitute the beginnings of a portable parallel programming environment. A project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about parallel computing, the specification being followed, the current hardware and software environment for parallel computing, and project management; we describe those we have learned. Finally, we discuss future developments for MPICH, including those necessary to accommodate extensions to the MPI Standard now being contemplated by the MPI Forum. 1
662|High performance messaging on workstations: Illinois Fast Messages (FM) for Myrinet  (1995) |In most computer systems, software overhead dominates the cost of messaging, reducing delivered performance, especially for short messages. Efficient software messaging layers are needed to deliver the hardware performance to the application level and to support tightly-coupled workstation clusters. Illinois Fast Messages (FM) 1.0 is a high speed messaging layer that delivers low latency and high bandwidth for short messages. For 128-byte packets, FM achieves bandwidths of 16.2 MB/s and one-way latencies 32 s on Myrinet-connected SPARCstations (user-level to user-level). For shorter packets, we have measured one-way latencies of 25 s, and for larger packets, bandwidth as high as to 19.6 MB/s  delivered bandwidth greater than OC-3. FM is also superior to the Myrinet API messaging layer, not just in terms of latency and usable bandwidth, but also in terms of the message half-power point (n 1 2 which is two orders of magnitude smaller (54 vs. 4,409 bytes). We describe the FM messaging primitives and the critical design issues in building a low-latency messaging layers for workstation clusters. Several issues are critical: the division of labor between host and network coprocessor, management of the input/output (I/O) bus, and buffer management. To achieve high performance, messaging layers should assign as much functionality as possible to the host. If the network interface has DMA capability, the I/O bus should be used asymmetrically, with
663|The Nexus approach to integrating multithreading and communication|Lightweight threads have an important role to play in parallel systems: they can be used to exploit shared-memory parallelism, to mask communication and I/O latencies, to implement remote memory access, and to support task-parallel and irregular applications. In this paper, we address the question of how to integrate threads and communication in high-performance distributed-memory systems. We propose an approach based on global pointer and remote service request mechanisms, and explain how these mechanisms support dynamic communication structures, asynchronous messaging, dynamic thread creation and destruction, and a global memory model via interprocessor references. We also explain how these mechanisms can be implemented in various environments. Our global pointer and remote service request mechanisms have been incorporated in a runtime system called Nexus that is used as a compiler target for parallel languages and as a substrate for higher-level communication libraries. We report the results of performance studies conducted using a Nexus implementation; these results indicate that Nexus mechanisms can be implemented efficiently on commodity hardware and software systems. 1
664|Legion: The Next Logical Step Toward a Nationwide Virtual Computer|The coming of giga-bit networks makes possible the realization of a single nationwide virtual computer comprised of a variety of geographically distributed high-performance machines and workstations. To realize the potential that the physical infrastructure provides, software must be developed that is easy to use, supports large degrees of parallelism in applications code, and manages the complexity of the underlying physical system for the user. This paper describes our approach to constructing and exploiting such &#034;metasystems&#034;. Our approach inherits features of earlier work on parallel processing systems and heterogeneous distributed computing systems. In particular, we are building on Mentat, an object-oriented parallel processing system developed at the University of Virginia. This report is a preliminary document. We expect changes to occur as the architecture and design of the system mature.

To realize the potential that the physical infrastructure provides, soft-ware must be developed that is easy to use, supports large degrees of parallelism in applications code, and manages the complexity of the underlying physical sys-tem for the usel: Legion is a metasystem project at the University of Virginia designed to provide users with a transparent intelface to the available resources, both at the programming interface level as well as at the user level. Legion addresses issues such as parallelism, fault-tolerance, security, autonomy, heterogeneity, resource management, and access transparency in a multi-language environment. In this paper we present a high-level overview of Legion, its vision, objectives, a brief sketch of how some of those objectives will be met, and the current status of the project.2 1 The Opportunity The dramatic increase in ubiquitously available net-work bandwidth will qualitatively change how the world computes, communicates, and collaborates. The rapid expansion of the world-wide web, and the changes that it has wrought are just the beginning. As high band-width connections become available they shrink  dis-tance and change our modes of computation, storage and interaction. Inevitably, users will operate in a wide-area environment that transparently consists of worksta-tions, personal computers, graphics rendering engines, supercomputers, and non-traditional devices: e.g., TVs,
666|An Abstract-Device Interface for Implementing  Portable Parallel-I/O Interfaces|In this paper, we propose a strategy for implementing parallel-I/O interfaces portably and efficiently. We have defined an abstract-device interface for parallel I/O, called ADIO. Any parallel-I/O API can be implemented on multiple file systems by implementing the API portably on top of ADIO, and implementing only ADIO on different file systems. This approach simplifies the task of implementing an API and yet exploits the specific high-performance features of individual file systems. We have used ADIO to implement the Intel PFS interface and subsets of MPI-IO and IBM PIOFS interfaces on PFS, PIOFS, Unix, and NFS file systems. Our performance studies indicate that the overhead of using ADIO as an implementation strategy...
667|Managing Multiple Communication Methods in High-Performance Networked Computing Systems|Modern networked computing environments and applications often require---or can benefit from---the use of multiple communication substrates, transport mechanisms, and protocols, chosen according to where communication is directed, what is communicated, or when communication is performed. We propose techniques that allow multiple communication methods to be supported transparently in a single application, with either automatic or user-specified selection criteria guiding the methods used for each communication. We explain how communication link and remote service request mechanisms facilitate the specification and implementation of multimethod communication. These mechanisms have been implemented in the Nexus multithreaded runtime system, and we use this system to illustrate solutions to various problems that arise when implementing multimethod communication. We also illustrate the application of our techniques by describing a multimethod, multithreaded implementation of the Message Pas...
668|Active Message Applications Programming Interface and Communication Subsystem Organization|High-performance network hardware is advancing, with multi-gigabit link bandwidths and sub-microsecond switch latencies. Network-interface hardware also continues to evolve, although the design space remains large and diverse. One critical abstraction, a simple, portable, and general-purpose communications interface, is required to make effective use of these increasingly high-performance networks and their capable interfaces. Without a new interface, the software overheads of existing ones will dominate communication costs, and many applications may not benefit from the advancements in network hardware. This document specifies a new active message communications interface for these networks. Its primitives, in essence an instruction set for communications, map efficiently onto underlying network hardware and compose effectively into higher-level protocols and applications. For high-performance implementations, the interface enables direct application-network interface interactions. In...
669|CC++: A Declarative Concurrent Object Oriented Programming Notation|CC++ is Compositional C++ , a parallel object-oriented notation that consists of C++ with six extensions. The goals of the CC++ project are to provide a theory, notation and tools for developing reliable scalable concurrent program libraries, and to provide a framework for unifying: 1. distributed reactive systems, batch-oriented numeric and symbolic applications, and user-interface systems, 2. declarative programs and object-oriented imperative programs, and 3. deterministic and nondeterministic programs. This paper is a brief description of the motivation for CC++ , the extensions to C++ , a few examples of CC++ programs with reasoning about their correctness, and an evaluation of CC++ in the context of other research on concurrent computation. A short description of C++ is provided.  
670|Software infrastructure for the I-WAY high-performance distributed computing experiment|High-speed wide area networks are expected to enable innovative applications that integrate geographically distributed, high-performance computing, database, graphics, and networking resources. However, there is as yet little understanding of the higher-level services required to support these applications, or of the techniques required to implement these services in a scalable, secure manner. We report on a large-scale prototyping effort that has yielded some insights into these issues. Building on the hardware base provided by the I-WAY, a national-scale Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, we developed an integrated management and application programming system, called I-Soft. This system was deployed at most of the 17 I-WAY sites and used by many of the 60 applications demonstrated on the I-WAY network. In this article, we describe the I-Soft design and report on lessons learned from application experiments. 1
671|Sharing Visualization Experiences among Remote Virtual Environments|Virtual reality has become an increasingly familiar part of the science of visualization and communication of information. This, combined with the increase in connectivity of remote sites via high-speed networks, allows for the development of a collaborative distributed virtual environment. Such an environment enables the development of supercomputer simulations with virtual reality visualizations that can be displayed at multiple sites, with each site interacting, viewing, and communicating about the results being discovered. The early results of an experimental collaborative virtual reality environment are discussed in this paper. The issues that need to be addressed in the implementation, as well as preliminary results are covered. Also provided are a discussion of plans and a generalized application programmers interface for CAVE to CAVE will be provided. 1 Introduction  Sharing a visualization experience among remote virtual environments is a new area of research within the field ...
672|Near-real-time Satellite Image Processing: Metacomputing in CC++|Metacomputing entails the combination of diverse, heterogeneous elements to provide a seamless, integrated computing service. We describe one such metacomputing application using Compositional C that integrates specialized resources, high-speed networks, parallel computers, and VR display technology to process satellite imagery in near-real-time. From the virtual environment, the user can query an InputHandler object for the latest available satellite data, select a satellite pass for processing by CloudDetector objects on a parallel supercomputer, and have the results rendered by a VisualizationManager object which could be a simple workstation, an ImmersaDesk or a CAVE. With an ImmersaDesk or CAVE, the user can navigate over a terrain with elevation and through the cloudscape data as it is being pumped in from the supercomputer. We discuss further issues for the development of metacomputing capabilities with regards to the integration of run-time systems, operating systems, high-s...
673|A Secure Communications Infrastructure for High-Performance Distributed Computing|We describe a software infrastructure designed to support the development of applications  that use high-speed networks to connect geographically distributed supercomputers,  databases, and scientific instruments. Such applications may need to operate over open  networks and access valuable resources, and hence can require mechanisms for ensuring  integrity and confidentiality of communications and for authenticating both users and  resources. Yet security solutions developed for traditional client-server applications do  not provide direct support for the distinctive program structures, programming tools,  and performance requirements encountered in these applications. To address these requirements,  we are developing a security-enhanced version of a communication library  called Nexus, which is then used to provide secure versions of various parallel libraries  and languages, including the popular Message Passing Interface. These tools support the  wide range of process creation mechan...
674|Remote Engineering Tools for the Design of Pollution Control Systems for Commercial Boilers|this paper, we discuss a pilot project involving a collaboration between Nalco Fuel Tech (NFT), a small company that has developed state-of-the-art emission reduction systems for commercial boilers, and the computational science group at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The key objective of this project is the development of a real-time, interactive capability that allows the user to drive the computational model from within the virtual environment. In this case, the required interaction involves the placement of chemical injection systems in the boiler and a quick evaluation of  their effectiveness in reducing undesirable emissions from the combustion process. The numerical model of the combustion process and its interaction with the chemical reactions used to reduce emissions is complex, and the solution is computationally intensive. The timely solution of these models depends on advanced numerical methods and the effective use of high-performance computing resources. Our approach includes an implementation of an injector model that can be run on a variety of architectures ranging from the IBM SP to networks of workstations. This calculation is separate from the visualization process and numerical results are communicated to the virtual boiler using the CAVEcomm message-passing library developed at Argonne National Laboratory [4]. The virtual boiler environment consists of several components designed to aide in the efficient optimization of the injection system. In this paper we discuss the software that allows rapid virtual boiler construction, various mechanisms for data visualization, and a package for the interactive placement of injector nozzles. Once the computational design process is complete, engineers are sent to the boiler site to install the injection s...
675|MPI on the I-WAY: A Wide-Area, Multimethod Implementation of the Message Passing Interface|High-speed wide-area networks enable innovative ap-plications that integrate geographically distributed com-puting, database, graphics, and networking resources. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) can be used as a portable, high-performance programming model for such systems. However, the wide-area environment in-troduces challenging problems for the MPI implementor, because of the heterogeneity of both the underlying physical infrastructure and the authentication and software environment at different sites. In this article, we describe an MPI implementation that incorporates so-lutions to these problems. This implementation, which was developed for the I-WAY distributed-computing ex-periment, was constructed by layering MPICH on the Nexus multithreaded runtime system. Nexus provides automatic configuration mechanisms that can be used to select and configure authentication, process creation, and communication mechanisms in heterogeneous systems. 
676|Resilient Overlay Networks|A Resilient Overlay Network (RON) is an architecture that allows distributed Internet applications to detect and recover from path outages and periods of degraded performance within several seconds, improving over todays wide-area routing protocols that take at least several minutes to recover. A RON is an application-layer overlay on top of the existing Internet routing substrate. The RON nodes monitor the functioning and quality of the Internet paths among themselves, and use this information to decide whether to route packets directly over the Internet or by way of other RON nodes, optimizing application-specific routing metrics. Results from two sets of measurements of a working RON deployed at sites scattered across the Internet demonstrate the benefits of our architecture. For instance, over a 64-hour sampling period in March 2001 across a twelve-node RON, there were 32 significant outages, each lasting over thirty minutes, over the 132 measured paths. RONs routing mechanism was able to detect, recover, and route around all of them, in less than twenty seconds on average, showing that its methods for fault detection and recovery work well at discovering alternate paths in the Internet. Furthermore, RON was able to improve the loss rate, latency, or throughput perceived by data transfers; for example, about 5 % of the transfers doubled their TCP throughput and 5 % of our transfers saw their loss probability reduced by 0.05. We found that forwarding packets via at most one intermediate RON node is sufficient to overcome faults and improve performance in most cases. These improvements, particularly in the area of fault detection and recovery, demonstrate the benefits of moving some of the control over routing into the hands of end-systems. 
677|Modeling TCP Throughput: A Simple Model and its Empirical Validation|In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCPs fast retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCPs timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeout events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates.

678|A Case for End System Multicast|Abstract  The conventional wisdom has been that IP is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP Multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow and congestion control. In this paper, we explore an alternative architecture that we term End System Multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP Multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, End System Multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP Multicast. In this paper, we study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems selforganize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred. I.
679|End-to-End Internet Packet Dynamics|  We discuss findings from a large-scale study of Internet packet dynamics conducted by tracing 20 000 TCP bulk transfers between 35 Internet sites. Because we traced each 100-kbyte transfer at both the sender and the receiver, the measurements allow us to distinguish between the end-toend behaviors due to the different directions of the Internet paths, which often exhibit asymmetries. We: 1) characterize the prevalence of unusual network events such as out-of-order delivery and packet replication; 2) discuss a robust receiver-based algorithm for estimating bottleneck bandwidth  that addresses deficiencies discovered in techniques based on packet pair; 3) investigate patterns of packet loss, finding that loss events are not well modeled as independent and, furthermore, that the distribution of the duration of loss events exhibits infinite variance; and 4) analyze variations in packet transit delays as indicators of congestion periods, finding that congestion periods also span a wide range of time scales. 
680|Equation-based congestion control for unicast applications|This paper proposes a mechanism for equation-based congestion control for unicast traffic. Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time. We use both simulations and experiments over the Internet to explore performance. We consider equation-based congestion control a promising avenue of development for congestion control of multicast traffic, and so an additional motivation for this work is to lay a sound basis for the further development of multicast congestion control.
681|Delayed internet routing convergence|AbstractThis paper examines the latency in Internet path failure, failover, and repair due to the convergence properties of interdomain routing. Unlike circuit-switched paths which exhibit failover on the order of milliseconds, our experimental mea-surements show that interdomain routers in the packet-switched Internet may take tens of minutes to reach a consistent view of the network topology after a fault. These delays stem from temporary routing table fluctuations formed during the operation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) path selection process on Internet backbone routers. During these periods of delayed convergence, we show that end-to-end Internet paths will experience intermittent loss of connectivity, as well as increased packet loss and latency. We present a two-year study of Internet routing convergence through the experimental instrumentation of key portions of the Internet infrastructure, including both passive data collection and fault-injection machines at major Internet exchange points. Based on data from the injection and measurement of several hundred thousand interdomain routing faults, we describe several unexpected properties of convergence and show that the measured upper bound on Internet interdomain routing convergence delay is an order of magnitude slower than previously thought. Our analysis also shows that the upper theoretic computational bound on the number of router states and control messages exchanged during the process of BGP convergence is factorial with respect to the number of autonomous systems in the Internet. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the observed convergence delay stems from specific router vendor implementation decisions and ambiguity in the BGP specification.

682|Internet Routing Instability|This paper examines the network inter-domain routing information exchanged between backbone service providers at the major U.S. public Internet exchange points. Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reachability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have lead to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In this paper, we describe several unexpected trends in routing instability, and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information. The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from BGP routing messages generated by border routers at five of the Internet core&#039;s public exchange points during a nine month period. We show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude more than expected and that the majority of this routing information is redundant, or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations for these anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on the Internet infrastructure. 
683|ALMI: An Application Level Multicast Infrastructure|The IP multicast model allows scalable and efficient multi-party communication, particularly for groups of large size. However, deployment of IP multicast requires substantial infrastructure modifications and is hampered by a host of unresolved open problems. To circumvent this situation, we have designed and implemented ALMI, an application level group communication middleware, which allows accelerated application deployment and simplified network configuration, without the need of network infrastructure support. ALMI is tailored toward support of multicast groups of relatively small size (several I Os of members) with many to many semantics. Session participants are connected via a vir- tual multicast tree, which consists of unicast connections between end hosts and is formed as a minimum spanning tree (MST) using application-specific performance metric. Using simulation, we show that the performance penalties, introduced by this shift of multicast to end systems, is a relatively small increase in traffic load and that ALMI multicast trees approach the efficiency of IP multicast trees. We have also implemented ALMi as a Java based middleware package and performed experiments over the Internet. Experimental results show that ALMI is able to cope with network dynamics and keep the mul- ticast tree efficient.
684|The End-to-End Effects of Internet Path Selection|The path taken by a packet traveling across the Internet depends on a large number of factors, including routing protocols and pernetwork routing policies. The impact of these factors on the endto -end performance experienced by users is poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a measurement-based study comparing the performance seen using the &#034;default&#034; path taken in the Internet with the potential performance available using some alternate path. Our study uses five distinct datasets containing measurements of &#034;path quality&#034;, such as round-trip time, loss rate, and bandwidth, taken between pairs of geographically diverse Internet hosts. We construct the set of potential alternate paths by composing these measurements to form new synthetic paths. We find that in 30-80% of the cases, there is an alternate path with significantly superior quality. We argue that the overall result is robust and we explore two hypotheses for explaining it. 
685|Measuring Link Bandwidths Using a Deterministic Model of Packet Delay|We describe a deterministic model of packet delay and use it to derive both the packet pair [2] property of FIFO-queueing networks and a new technique (packet tailgating) for actively measuring link bandwidths. Compared to previously known techniques, packet tailgating usually consumes less network bandwidth, does not rely on consistent behavior of routers handling ICMP packets, and does not rely on timely delivery of acknowledgments.  Preliminary empirical measurements in the Internet indicate that compared to current measurement tools, packet tailgating sends an order of magnitude fewer packets, while maintaining approximately the same accuracy. Unfortunately, for all currently available measurement tools, including our prototype implementation of packet tailgating, accuracy is low for paths longer than a few hops.  1. INTRODUCTION  As long as Internet bandwidth has increased, the amount of trac sent over the Internet has grown to consume it. This means that despite the increasing li...
686|SPAND: Shared Passive Network Performance Discovery|In the Internet today, users and applications must often make decisions based on the performance they expect to receive from other Internet hosts. For example, users can often view many Web pages in low-bandwidth or high-bandwidth versions, while other pages present users with long lists of mirror sites to chose from. Current techniques to perform these decisions are often ad hoc or poorly designed. The most common solution used today is to require the user to manually make decisions based on their own experience and whatever information is provided by the application. Previous efforts to automate this decision-making process have relied on isolated, active network probes from a host. Unfortunately, this method of making measurements has several problems. Active probing introduces unnecessary network traffic that can quickly become a significant part of the total traffic handled by busy Web servers. Probing from a single host results in less accurate information and more redundant network probes than a system that shares information with nearby hosts. In this paper, we propose a system called SPAND (Shared Passive Network Performance Discovery) that determines network characteristics by making shared, passive measurements from a collection of hosts. In this paper, we show why using passive measurements from a collection of hosts has advantages over using active measurements from a single host. We also show that sharing measurements can significantly increase the accuracy and timeliness of predictions. In addition, we present a initial prototype design of SPAND, the current implementation status of our system, and initial performance results that show the potential benefits of SPAND.  
687|An Architecture for Large-Scale Internet Measurement|Historically, the Internet has been woefully under-measured and under-instrumented. The problem is only getting worse with the network&#039;s ever-increasing size. We discuss the goals and requirements for building a &#034;measurement infrastructure &#034; for the Internet, in which a collection of measurement &#034;platforms&#034; cooperatively measure the properties of Internet paths and clouds by exchanging test traffic among themselves. The key emphasis of the architecture, which forms the underpinnings of the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI) project, is on tackling problems related to scale. Consequently, the architecture emphasizes decentralized control of measurements; strong authentication and security; mechanisms for both maintaining tight administrative control over who can perform what measurements using which platforms, and delegation of some forms of measurement as a site&#039;s measurement policy permits; and simple configuration and maintenance of platforms. 1 Introduction Histori...
688|Detour: a Case for Informed Internet Routing and Transport|Despite its obvious success, robustness, and scalability, the Internet suffers from a number of end-to-end performance and availability problems. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the Internet&#039;s inefficiencies and then we argue that Internet behavior can be improved by spreading intelligent routers at key access and interchange points to actively manage traffic. Our Detour prototype aims to demonstrate practical benefits to end users, without penalizing non-Detour users, by aggregating traffic information across connections and using more efficient routes to improve Internet performance. 1 Introduction  By any metric, the Internet has scaled remarkably; from 4 nodes in 1969 to an estimated 25 million hosts and 100 million users today. This reflects a sustained growth rate over three decades of roughly 80% per year, all while providing nearly continuous service. As a system, the Internet&#039;s growth has been matched only by the major infrastructure projects of the early 1900&#039;s: the ele...
689|Experimental Study of Internet Stability and Wide-Area Backbone Failures|In this paper, we describe an experimental study of Internet stability and the origins of failure in Internet protocol backbones. The stability of end-to-end Internet paths is dependent both on the underlying telecommunication switching system, as well as the higher level software and hardware components specific to the Internet&#039;s packet-switched forwarding and routing architecture. Although a number of earlier studies have examined failures in the public telecommunication system, little attention has been given to the characterization of Internet stability. Our paper analyzes Internet failures from three different perspectives. We first examine several recent major Internet failures and their probable origins. These empirical observations illustrate the complexity of the Internet and show that unlike commercial transaction systems, the interactions of the underlying components of the Internet are poorly understood. Next, our examination focuses on the stability of paths between In...
690|End-to-end WAN Service Availability|This study seeks to understand how network failures affect the availability of service delivery across wide area networks and to evaluate classes of techniques for improving end-to-end service availability. Using several large-scale connectivity traces, we develop a model of network unavailability that includes key parameters such as failure location and failure duration. We then use trace-based simulation to evaluate several classes of techniques for coping with network unavailability. We find that caching alone is seldom effective at insulating services from failures but that the combination of mobile extension code and prefetching can improve average unavailability by as much as an order of magnitude for classes of service whose semantics support disconnected operation. We find that routing-based techniques may provide significant improvements, but that the improvements of many individual techniques are limited because they do not address all significant categories of network failures. By combining the techniques we examine, some systems may be able to reduce average unavailability by as much as one or two orders of magnitude.
691|Analyzing Stability in WideArea Network Performance|The Internet is a very large scale, complex, dynamical system that is hard to model and analyze. In this paper, we develop and analyze statistical models for the observed end-to-end network performance based on extensive packet-level traces (consisting of approximately 1.5 billion packets) collected from the primary Web site for the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996. We find that observed mean throughputs for these transfers measured over 60 million complete connections vary widely as a function of endhost location and time of day, confirming that the Internet is characterized by a large degree of heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, we find (using best-fit linear regression techniques) that we can express the throughput for Web transfers to most hosts as a random variable with a log-normal distribution. Then, using observed throughput as the control parameter, we attempt to quantify the spatial (statistical similarity across neighboring hosts) and temporal (persistence over time) stability of network performance. We find that Internet hosts that are close to each other often have almost identically distributed probability distributions of throughput. We also find that throughputs to individual hosts often do not change appreciably for several minutes. Overall, these results indicate that there is promise in protocol mechanisms that cache and share network characteristics both within a single host and amongst nearby hosts. 1.
692|Best-Effort versus Reservations: A Simple Comparative Analysis|The current Internet only offers best-effort service. In recent years much research  effort, and IETF standardization activity, has been devoted to extending the Internet  architecture to support reservations. However, the wisdom of such an extension  continues to remain in doubt. Using a simple analytical model, this paper addresses  the following question: Should the Internet retain its best-effort-only architecture,  or should it adopt one that is reservation-capable? We characterize the differences  between reservation-capable and best-effort-only networks in terms of application  performance and total welfare. Our analysis does not yield a definitive answer to the  question we pose, since it would necessarily depend on unknowable factors such as the  future cost of network bandwidth and the nature of the future traffic load. However,  our model does reveal some interesting phenomena. First, in some circumstances,  the amount of incremental bandwidth needed to make a best-effort-on...
694|Experiences with NIMI|NIMI (National Internet Measurement Infrastructure) is a software system for building network measurement infrastructures. Its design emphasizes  (i) large-scale infrastructures composed from diversely-administered hosts, rather than infrastructures controlled by a single entity, and (ii) facilitating diverse types of measurements by diverse parties, some of whom are allowed richer access to certain portions of the infrastructure than others. We discuss our experiences with developing and operating the infrastructure to date: problems we have encountered, both foreseen and unanticipated, mistakes we made, and how we have adapted the design to address these. We also explore two key issues for developing a large-scale, extensible infrastructure: the problem of securely updating software on the measurement platforms, and the problem of constraining the resources consumed by different measurements. We argue that both of these can be unified in terms of controlling the behavior of the measu...
695|The X-Bone|The X-Bone is a system for the rapid, automated deployment and management of overlay networks. Overlay networks use encapsulation to enable virtual infrastructure, and they are being used more frequently to implement experimental networks and dedicated subnets over the Internet. Existing overlays, such as the M-Bone for multicast IP and 6-Bone for IPv6, require manual configuration and management, both to establish connectivity and to ensure efficient resource utilization. The X-Bone uses a graphical interface and multipoint control channel to manage overlay deployment at the IP layer, much like multimedia sessions are controlled via the session directory (sd) tool. The X-Bone enables rapidly deployable virtual infrastructure, that is critical to the development of both network and application services, and that is also useful for deploying isolated infrastructure for restricted purposes. This document describes the architecture of the X-Bone. 1
696|Predicting TCP Throughput from Non-invasive Network Sampling|In this paper, we wish to derive analytic models that predict the performance of TCP flows between specified endpoints using routinely observed network characteristics such as loss and delay. The ultimate goal of our approach is to convert network observables into representative user and application relevant performance metrics. The main contributions of this paper are in studying which network performance data sources are most reflective of session characteristics, and then in thoroughly investigating a new TCP model based on [1] that uses non-invasive network samples to predict the throughput of representative TCP flows between given end-points.
697|UUCP Mail Interchange Format Standard|In response to the need for maintenance of current information about the status and progress of various projects in the ARPA-Internet community, this RFC is issued for the benefit of community members. The information contained in this document is accurate as of the date of publication, but is subject to change. Subsequent RFCs will reflect such changes. This document defines the standard format for the transmission of mail messages between machines in the UUCP Project. It does not address the format for storage of messages on one machine, nor the lower level transport mechanisms used to get the data from one machine to the next. It represents a standard for conformance by hosts in the UUCP zone. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 1.
698|FIRE: Flexible Intra-AS Routing Environment|Current routing protocols are monolithic, specifying the algorithm used to construct forwarding tables, the metric used by the algorithm (generally some form of hop count), and the protocol used to distribute these metrics as an integrated package. The Flexible Intra-AS Routing Environment (FIRE) is a link-state, intra-domain routing protocol that decouples these components. FIRE supports run-time-programmable algorithms and metrics over a secure link-state distribution protocol. By allowing the network operator to dynamically reprogram both the properties being advertised and the routing algorithms used to construct forwarding tables, FIRE enables the development and deployment of novel routing algorithms without the need for a new protocol to distribute state. FIRE supports multiple concurrent routing algorithms and metrics, each constructing separate forwarding tables. By using operator-specified packet filters, separate classes of traffic may be routed using completely different routing algorithms, all supported by a single routing protocol. This paper
699|The Detour Framework for Packet Rerouting|this paper---is to support this deployment.
700|Scalable Application Layer Multicast|We describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. Our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with desirable properties. We present extensive simulations of both our protocol and the Narada application-layer multicast protocol over Internet-like topologies. Our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar endto-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. More importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic. Finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. In our experiments, averagegroup members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1 % as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. The average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 Kbps for groups of size 100.
701|Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-Peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications|A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.
702|A Scalable Content-Addressable Network|Hash tables  which map keys  onto values  are an essential building block in modern software systems. We believe a similar functionality would be equally valuable to large distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a Content-Addressable Network (CAN) as a distributed infrastructure that provides hash table-like functionality on Internet-like scales. The CAN is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation. 
703|Tapestry: An infrastructure for fault-tolerant wide-area location and routing|In todays chaotic network, data and services are mobile and replicated widely for availability, durability, and locality. Components within this infrastructure interact in rich and complex ways, greatly stressing traditional approaches to name service and routing. This paper explores an alternative to traditional approaches called Tapestry. Tapestry is an overlay location and routing infrastructure that provides location-independent routing of messages directly to the closest copy of an object or service using only point-to-point links and without centralized resources. The routing and directory information within this infrastructure is purely soft state and easily repaired. Tapestry is self-administering, faulttolerant, and resilient under load. This paper presents the architecture and algorithms of Tapestry and explores their advantages through a number of experiments. 1
704|How to Model an Internetwork|Graphs are commonly used to model the structure of internetworks, for the study of problems ranging from routing to resource reservation. A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, &#034;well-known&#034; topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a Transit-Stub model that correlates well with Internet structure. Improved models for internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of simulation studies of internetworking solutions, providing basis for the validi...
705|SCRIBE: A large-scale and decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure|This paper presents Scribe, a scalable application-level multicast infrastructure. Scribe supports large numbers of groups, with a potentially large number of members per group. Scribe is built on top of Pastry, a generic peer-to-peer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the Internet, and leverages Pastry&#039;s reliability, self-organization, and locality properties. Pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group. Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees, but we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability. Simulation results, based on a realistic network topology model, show that Scribe scales across a wide range of groups and group sizes. Also, it balances the load on the nodes while achieving acceptable delay and link stress when compared to IP multicast.
706|Bayeux: An architecture for scalable and fault-tolerant wide-area data dissemination|The demand for streaming multimedia applications is growing at an incredible rate. In this paper, we propose Bayeux, an efficient application-level multicast system that scales to arbitrarily large receiver groups while tolerating failures in routers and network links. Bayeux also includes specific mechanisms for load-balancing across replicate root nodes and more efficient bandwidth consumption. Our simulation results indicate that Bayeux maintains these properties while keeping transmission overhead low. To achieve these properties, Bayeux leverages the architecture of Tapestry, a fault-tolerant, wide-area overlay routing and location network.
707|Application-Level Multicast Using Content-Addressable Networks|Most currently proposed solutions to application-level multicast organize  the group members into an application-level mesh over which a DistanceVector  routing protocol, or a similar algorithm, is used to construct source-rooted  distribution trees. The use of a global routing protocol limits the scalability of  these systems. Other proposed solutions that scale to larger numbers of receivers  do so by restricting the multicast service model to be single-sourced. In this paper,  we propose an application-level multicast scheme capable of scaling to large  group sizes without restricting the service model to a single source. Our scheme  builds on recent work on Content-Addressable Networks (CANs). Extending the  CAN framework to support multicast comes at trivial additional cost and, because  of the structured nature of CAN topologies, obviates the need for a multicast  routing algorithm. Given the deployment of a distributed infrastructure such as a  CAN, we believe our CAN-based multicast scheme offers the dual advantages of  simplicity and scalability.
708|SCRIBE: The design of a large-scale event notification infrastructure|This paper presents Scribe, a large-scale event notification infrastructure  for topic-based publish-subscribe applications. Scribe supports large numbers  of topics, with a potentially large number of subscribers per topic. Scribe is  built on top of Pastry, a generic peer-to-peer object location and routing substrate  overlayed on the Internet, and leverages Pastry&#039;s reliability, self-organization and  locality properties. Pastry is used to create a topic (group) and to build an efficient  multicast tree for the dissemination of events to the topic&#039;s subscribers  (members). Scribe provides weak reliability guarantees, but we outline how an  application can extend Scribe to provide stronger ones.
710|Host Multicast: A Framework for Delivering Multicast To End Users|While the advantages of multicast delivery over multiple unicast deliveries is undeniable, the deployment of the IP multicast protocol has been limited to &#034;islands&#034; of network domains under single administrative control. Deployment of inter-domain multicast delivery has been slow due to both technical and administrative reasons. In this paper we propose a Host Multicast Tree Protocol (HMTP) that (1) automates the interconnection of IP-multicast enabled islands and (2) provides multicast delivery to end hosts where IP multicast is not available. With HMTP, end-hosts and proxy gateways of IP multicast-enabled islands can dynamically create shared multicast trees across different islands. Members of an HMTP multicast group self-organize into an efficient, scalable and robust multicast tree. The tree structure is adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in group membership and network topology. Simulation results show that the multicast tree has low cost, and data delivered over it experiences moderately low latency. I. 
711|Scalable Secure Group Communication over IP Multicast|We introduce and analyze a scalable re-keying scheme for implementing secure group communications IP multicast. We show that our scheme incurs constant processing, message, and storage overhead for a re-key operation when a single member joins or leaves the group, and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership. These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a-priori.
712|Fuzzy extractors: How to generate strong keys from biometrics and other noisy data|We provide formal definitions and efficient secure techniques for  turning noisy information into keys usable for any cryptographic application, and, in particular,  reliably and securely authenticating biometric data. Our techniques apply not just to biometric information, but to any keying material that, unlike traditional cryptographic keys, is (1) not reproducible precisely and (2) not distributed uniformly. We propose two primitives: a fuzzy extractor reliably extracts nearly uniform randomness R from its input; the extraction is error-tolerant in the sense that R will be the same even if the input changes, as long as it remains reasonably close to the original. Thus, R can be used as a key in a cryptographic application. A secure sketch produces public information about its input w that does not reveal w, and yet allows exact recovery of w given another value that is close to w. Thus, it can be used to reliably reproduce error-prone biometric inputs without incurring the security risk inherent in storing them. We define the primitives to be both formally secure and versatile, generalizing much prior work. In addition, we provide nearly optimal constructions of both primitives for various measures of closeness of input data, such as Hamming distance, edit distance, and set difference.
713|Pseudo-Random Generation from One-Way Functions|Pseudorandom generators are fundamental to many theoretical and applied aspects of computing. We show howto construct a pseudorandom generator from any oneway function. Since it is easy to construct a one-way function from a pseudorandom generator, this result shows that there is a pseudorandom generator iff there is a one-way function.
714|On the Resemblance and Containment of Documents|Given two documents A and B we define two mathematical notions: their  resemblance r(A, B)andtheircontainment c(A, B) that seem to capture well  the informal notions of &#034;roughly the same&#034; and &#034;roughly contained.&#034;  The basic idea is to reduce these issues to set intersection problems that can  be easily evaluated by a process of random sampling that can be done independently  for each document. Furthermore, the resemblance can be evaluated  using a fixed size sample for each document.
715|Secret Key Agreement by Public Discussion From Common Information|. The problem of generating a shared secret key S by two parties knowing dependent random variables X and Y , respectively, but not sharing a secret key initially, is considered. An enemy who knows the random variable Z, jointly distributed with X and Y  according to some probability distribution PXY Z , can also receive all messages exchanged by the two parties over a public channel. The goal of a protocol is that the enemy obtains at most a negligible amount of information about S. Upper bounds on H(S) as a function of  PXY Z are presented. Lower bounds on the rate H(S)=N (as N !1) are derived for the case where X = [X 1 ; : : : ; XN ], Y = [Y 1 ; : : : ; YN ] and Z = [Z 1 ; : : : ; ZN ] result from N independent executions of a random experiment generating X i ; Y i and Z i , for i = 1; : : : ; N . In particular it is shown that such secret key agreement is possible for a scenario where all three parties receive the output of a binary symmetric source over independent binary symmetr...
716|Improved Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Algebraic-Geometry Codes|Given an error-correcting code over strings of length n and an arbitrary input string also of length n, the list decoding problem is that of finding all codewords within a specified Hamming distance from the input string. We present an improved list decoding algorithm for decoding Reed-Solomon codes. The list decoding problem for Reed-Solomon codes reduces to the following &#034;curve-fitting&#034; problem over a field F : Given n points f(x i :y i )g i=1 , x i
717|Generalized Privacy Amplification| This paper provides a general treatment of privacy amplification by public discussion, a concept introduced by Bennett, Brassard and Robert for a special scenario. Privacy amplification is a process that allows two parties to distill a secret key from a common random variable about which an eavesdropper has partial information. The two parties generally know nothing about the eavesdropper&#039;s information except that it satisfies a certain constraint. The results have applications to unconditionally-secure secret-key agreement protocols and quantum cryptography, and they yield results on wire-tap and broadcast channels for a considerably strengthened definition of secrecy capacity.  
718|A Fuzzy Commitment Scheme|We combine well-known techniques from the areas of errorcorrecting codes and cryptography to achieve a new type of cryptographic primitive that we refer to as a fuzzy commitment scheme. Like a conventional cryptographic commitment scheme, our fuzzy commitment scheme is both concealing and binding: it is infeasible for an attacker to learn the committed value, and also for the committer to decommit a value in more than one way. In a conventional scheme, a commitment must be opened using a unique witness, which acts, essentially, as a decryption key. By contrast, our scheme is fuzzy in the sense that it accepts a witness that is close to the original encrypting witness in a suitable metric, but not necessarily identical. This characteristic of our fuzzy commitment scheme makes it useful for applications such as biometric authentication systems, in which data is subject to random noise. Because the scheme is tolerant of error, it is capable of protecting biometric data just as conventional cryptographic techniques, like hash functions, are used to protect alphanumeric passwords.  This addresses a major outstanding problem in the theory of biometric authentication.  We prove the security characteristics of our fuzzy commitment scheme relative to the properties of an underlying cryptographic hash function.
719|A fuzzy vault scheme|Abstract. We describe a simple and novel cryptographic construction that we refer to as a fuzzy vault. A player Alice may place a secret value ? in a fuzzy vault and lock  it using a set A of elements from some public universe U. If Bob tries to unlock  the vault using a set B of similar length, he obtains ? only if B is close to A, i.e., only if A and B overlap substantially. In constrast to previous constructions of this flavor, ours possesses the useful feature of order invariance, meaning that the ordering of A and B is immaterial to the functioning of the vault. As we show, our scheme enjoys provable security against a computationally unbounded attacker.
720|Password Security: A Case History|This paper describes the history of the design of the password security scheme on a  remotely accessed time-sharing system. The present design was the result of countering  observed attempts to penetrate the system. The result is a compromise between extreme  security and ease of use.
721|Randomness is Linear in Space|We show that any randomized algorithm that runs in space S and time T and uses poly(S) random bits can be simulated using only O(S) random bits in space S and time T poly(S). A deterministic simulation in space S follows. Of independent interest is our main technical tool: a procedure which extracts randomness from a defective random source using a small additional number of truly random bits. 1
723|Password Hardening Based on Keystroke Dynamics|Abstract. We present a novel approach to improving the security of passwords. In our approach, the legitimate users typing patterns (e.g., durations of keystrokes and latencies between keystrokes) are combined with the users password to generate a hardened password that is convincingly more secure than conventional passwords alone. In addition, our scheme automatically adapts to gradual changes in a users typing patterns while maintaining the same hardened password across multiple logins, for use in file encryption or other applications requiring a long-term secret key. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme, we give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of use, improved security, and performance.
724|A Proposal for an ISO Standard for Public Key Encryption (version 2.0)  (2001) |This document should be viewed less as a first draft of a standard for public-key encryption, and more as a proposal for what such a draft standard should contain. It is hoped that this proposal will serve as a basis for discussion, from which a consensus for a standard may be formed.
726|Reusable cryptographic fuzzy extractors|We show that a number of recent definitions and constructions of fuzzy extractors are not adequate for multiple uses of the same fuzzy secreta major shortcoming in the case of biometric applications. We propose two particularly stringent security models that specifically address the case of fuzzy secret reuse, respectively from an outsider and an insider perspective, in what we call a chosen perturbation attack. We characterize the conditions that fuzzy extractors need to satisfy to be secure, and present generic constructions from ordinary building blocks. As an illustration, we demonstrate how to use a biometric secret in a remote error tolerant authentication protocol that does not require any storage on the clients side. 1
727|Extracting Randomness: A Survey and New Constructions|this paper we do two things. First, we survey extractors and dispersers: what they are, how they can be designed, and some of their applications. The work described in the survey is due to a long list of research papers by various authors##most notably by David Zuckerman. Then, we present a new tool for constructing explicit extractors and give two new constructions that greatly improve upon previous results. The new tool we devise, a merger,&#034; is a function that accepts d strings, one of which is uniformly distributed and outputs a single string that is guaranteed to be uniformly distributed. We show how to build good explicit mergers, and how mergers can be used to build better extractors. Using this, we present two new constructions. The first construction succeeds in extracting all of the randomness from any somewhat random source. This improves upon previous extractors that extract only some of the randomness from somewhat random sources with enough&#034; randomness. The amount of truly random bits used by this extractor, however, is not optimal. The second extractor we build extracts only some of the randomness and works only for sources with enough randomness, but uses a nearoptimal amount of truly random bits. Extractors and dispersers have many applications in removing randomness&#034; in various settings and in making randomized constructions explicit. We survey some of these applications and note whenever our new constructions yield better results, e.g., plugging our new extractors into a previous construction we achieve the first explicit N-superconcentrators of linear size and polyloglog(N) depth. ] 1999 Academic Press  CONTENTS  1. 
728|Subquadratic-time factoring of polynomials over finite fields|Abstract. New probabilistic algorithms are presented for factoring univariate polynomials over finite fields. The algorithms factor a polynomial of degree n over a finite field of constant cardinality in time O(n 1.815). Previous algorithms required time T(n 2+o(1)). The new algorithms rely on fast matrix multiplication techniques. More generally, to factor a polynomial of degree n over the finite field Fq with q elements, the algorithms use O(n 1.815 log q) arithmetic operations in Fq. The new baby step/giant step  techniques used in our algorithms also yield new fast practical algorithms at super-quadratic asymptotic running time, and subquadratic-time methods for manipulating normal bases of finite fields. 1.
729|Set Reconciliation with Nearly Optimal Communication Complexity|We consider the problem of efficiently reconciling two similar sets held by different hosts while minimizing the communication complexity. This type of problem arises naturally from gossip protocols used for the distribution of information. We describe an approach to set reconciliation based on the encoding of sets as polynomials. The resulting protocols exhibit tractable computational complexity and nearly optimal communication complexity. Also, these protocols can be adapted to work over a broadcast channel, allowing many clients to reconcile with one host based on a single broadcast, even if each client is missing a different subset.
730|Robust fuzzy extractors and authenticated key agreement from close secrets|Consider two parties holding samples from correlated distributions W and W ', respectively, where these samples are within distance t of each other in some metric space. The parties wish to agree on a close-to-uniformly distributed secret key R by sending a single message over an insecure channel controlled by an all-powerful adversary who may read and modify anything sent over the channel. We consider both the keyless case, where the parties share no additional secret information, and the keyed case, where the parties share a long-term secret SKBSM that they can use to generate a sequence of session keys {Rj} using multiple pairs {(Wj, W ' j)}. The former has applications to, e.g., biometric authentication, while the latter arises in, e.g., the bounded-storage model with errors. We show solutions that improve upon previous work in several respects:  The best prior solution for the keyless case with no errors (i.e., t = 0) requires the minentropy of W to exceed 2n/3, where n is the bit-length of W. Our solution applies whenever the min-entropy of W exceeds the minimal threshold n/2, and yields a longer key.  Previous solutions for the keyless case in the presence of errors (i.e., t&gt; 0) required random oracles. We give the first constructions (for certain metrics) in the standard model.  Previous solutions for the keyed case were stateful. We give the first stateless solution. 1
731|Efficient Cryptographic Protocols based on Noisy Channels|The Wire-Tap Channel of Wyner [20] shows that a Binary Symmetric Channel may be used as a basis for exchanging a secret key, in a cryptographic scenario of two honest people facing an eavesdropper. Later Cr&#039;epeau and Kilian [9] showed how a BSC may be used to implement Oblivious Transfer in a cryptographic scenario of two possibly dishonest people facing each other. Unfortunately this result is rather impractical as it requires\Omega\Gamma  n  11  ) bits to be transmitted through the BSC to accomplish a single OT. The current paper provides efficient protocols to achieve the cryptographic primitives of Bit Commitment and Oblivious Transfer based on the existence of a Binary Symmetric Channel. Our protocols respectively require sending O(n) and  O(n  3  ) bits through the BSC. These results are based on a technique known as Generalized Privacy Amplification [1] that allow two people to extract secret information from partially compromised data. 1 Introduction  The cryptographic power of...
732|Correcting errors without leaking partial information|This paper explores what kinds of information two parties must communicate in order to correct errors which occur in a shared secret string W. Any bits they communicate must leak a significant amount of information about W  that is, from the adversarys point of view, the entropy of W will drop significantly. Nevertheless, we construct schemes with which Alice and Bob can prevent an adversary from learning any useful information about W. Specifically, if the entropy of W is sufficiently high, then there is no function f(W) which the adversary can learn from the error-correction information with significant probability. This leads to several new results: (a) the design of noise-tolerant perfectly oneway hash functions in the sense of Canetti et al. [7], which in turn leads to obfuscation of proximity queries for high entropy secrets W; (b) private fuzzy extractors [11], which allow one to extract uniformly random bits from noisy and nonuniform data W, while also insuring that no sensitive information about W is leaked; and (c) noise tolerance and stateless key re-use in the Bounded Storage Model, resolving the main open problem of Ding [10]. The heart of our constructions is the design of strong randomness extractors with the property that the source W can be recovered from the extracted randomness and any string W ' which is close to W.
733|Simple and tight bounds for information reconciliation and privacy amplification|Abstract. Shannon entropy is a useful and important measure in information processing, for instance, data compression or randomness extraction, under the assumptionwhich can typically safely be made in communication theorythat a certain random experiment is independently repeated many times. In cryptography, however, where a systems working has to be proven with respect to a malicious adversary, this assumption usually translates to a restriction on the latters knowledge or behavior and is generally not satisfied. An example is quantum key agreement, where the adversary can attack each particle sent through the quantum channel differently or even carry out coherent attacks, combining a number of particles together. In information-theoretic key agreement, the central functionalities of information reconciliation and privacy amplification have, therefore, been extensively studied in the scenario of general distributions: Partial solutions have been given, but the obtained bounds are arbitrarily far from tight, and a full analysis appeared
734|List decoding algorithms for certain concatenated codes|We give efficient (polynomial-time) list-decoding algorithms for certain families of error-correcting codes obtained by concatenation. Specifically, we give list-decoding algorithms for codes where the outer code  is a Reed-Solomon or Algebraic-geometric code and the inner code  is a Hadamard code. Codes obtained by such concatenation are the best known constructions of errorcorrecting codes with very large minimum distance. Our decoding algorithms enhance their nice combinatorial properties with algorithmic ones, by decoding these codes up to the currently known bound on their list-decoding capacity. In particular, the number of errors that we can correct matches (exactly) the number of errors for which it is known that the list size is bounded by a polynomial in the length of the codewords. 1
735|On the Relation of Error Correction and Cryptography to an Off Line Biometric Based Identification Scheme|An off-line biometric identification protocol based on error correcting  codes was recently developed as an enabling technology for secure  biometric based user authentication. The protocol was designed to  bind a user&#039;s iris biometric template with authorization information  via a magnetic strip in the off-line case while reducing the exposure of  a user&#039;s biometric data. In this paper we give an in depth discussion  of the role of error correcting codes in the cryptographically secure  biometric authentication scheme.  An Iris scan is a biometric technology which uses the human iris to authenticate users [BAW96, HMW90, Dau92, Wil96]. This technology produces a 2048 bit user biometric template such that any future scan of the same user&#039;s iris will generate a &#034;similar&#034; template.

736|Upper Bounds for Constant-Weight Codes|Let A(n; d; w) denote the maximum possible number of codewords in an (n; d; w) constant-weight binary code. We improve upon the best known upper bounds on A(n; d; w) in numerous instances for n 6 24 and d 6 12,  which is the parameter range of existing tables. Most improvements occur for d = 8; 10, where we reduce the upper bounds in more than half of the unresolved cases. We also extend the existing tables up to n 6 28 and d 6 14.  To obtain these results, we develop new techniques and introduce new classes of codes. We derive a number of general bounds on A(n; d; w) by means of mapping constantweight codes into Euclidean space. This approach produces, among other results, a bound on A(n; d; w) that is tighter than the Johnson bound. A similar improvement over the best known bounds for doubly-constant-weight codes, studied by Johnson and Levenshtein, is obtained in the same way. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of doubly-boundedweight codes, which may be thought of as a generaliz...
737|Secure Applications of Low-Entropy Keys|We introduce the notion of key stretching, a mechanism to  convert short s-bit keys into longer keys, such that the complexity required  to brute-force search a s + t-bit keyspace is the same as the time  required to brute-force search a s-bit key stretched by t bits.
738|Reliable Biometric Authentication with Privacy Protection|Abstract. We propose a new scheme for reliable authentication of physical objects. The scheme allows not only the combination of noisy data with cryptographic functions but has the additional property that the stored reference information is non-revealing. By breaking into the database and retrieving the stored data, the attacker will not be able to obtain any realistic approximation of the original physical object. This technique has applications in secure storage of biometric templates in databases and in authentication of PUFs (Physical Uncloneable Functions). 1.
739|Secure sketch for biometric templates|Abstract. There have been active discussions on how to derive a consistent cryptographic key from noisy data such as biometric templates, with the help of some extra information called a sketch. It is desirable that the sketch reveals little information about the biometric templates even in the worst case (i.e., the entropy loss should be low). The main difficulty is that many biometric templates are represented as points in continuous domains with unknown distributions, whereas known results either work only in discrete domains, or lack rigorous analysis on the entropy loss. A general approach to handle points in continuous domains is to quantize (discretize) the points and apply a known sketch scheme in the discrete domain. However, it can be difficult to analyze the entropy loss due to quantization and to find the optimal  quantizer. In this paper, instead of trying to solve these problems directly, we propose to examine the relative entropy loss of any given scheme, which bounds the number of additional bits we could have extracted if we used the optimal parameters. We give a general scheme and show that the relative entropy loss due to suboptimal discretization is at most (nlog 3), where n is the number of points, and the bound is tight. We further illustrate how our scheme can be applied to real biometric data by giving a concrete scheme for face biometrics.
740|Optimal error correction against computationally bounded noise|Abstract. For computationally bounded adversarial models of error, we construct appealingly simple, efficient, cryptographic encoding and unique decoding schemes whose error-correction capability is much greater than classically possible. In particular: 1. For binary alphabets, we construct positive-rate coding schemes which are uniquely decodable from a 1/2 - ? error rate for any constant ?&gt; 0. 2. For large alphabets, we construct coding schemes which are uniquely decodable from a 1 -  v R error rate for any information rate R&gt; 0. Our results are qualitatively stronger than related work: the construction works in the public-key model (requiring no shared secret key or joint local state) and allows the channel to know everything that the receiver knows. In addition, our techniques can potentially be used to construct coding schemes that have information rates approaching the Shannon limit. Finally, our construction is qualitatively optimal: we show that unique decoding under high error rates is impossible in several natural relaxations of our model. 1
741|Lower bounds for embedding edit distance into normed spaces|MIT S. Raskhodnikova MIT 1 Introduction The edit distance (also called Levenshtein metric) between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions and character substitutions) needed to transform one string into another. This distance is of key importance in computational biology, as well as text processing and other areas. Algorithms for problems involving this metric have been extensively investigated. In particular, the quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings is one of the most investigated and used algorithms in computational biology. Recently, a new approach to problems involving edit distance has been proposed. Its basic component is construction of a mapping f (called an embedding), which maps any string s into a vector f (s) 2!
742|Tight Bounds for Depth-Two Superconcentrators|We show that the minimum size of a depth-two N-superconcentrator is \Theta(N log² N= log log N ). Before this work, optimal bounds were known for all depths except two. For the upper bound, we build superconcentrators by putting together a small number of disperser graphs; these disperser graphs are obtained using a probabilistic argument. We present two different methods for showing lower bounds. First, we show that superconcentrators contain several disjoint disperser graphs. When combined with the lower bound for disperser graphs due to Kovari, S&#039;os and Tur&#039;an, this gives an almost optimal lower bound of \Omega\Gamma N(log N= log log N )²) on the size of N - superconcentrators. The second method, based on the work of Hansel, gives the optimal lower bound.  The method of the Kovari, S&#039;os and Tur&#039;an can be extended to give tight lower bounds for extractors, both in terms of the number of truly random bits needed to extract one additional bit and in terms of the unavoidable entr...
743|Practical Set Reconciliation|We consider the problem of efficiently reconciling two similar sets held by different hosts. This problem is motivated by the problem of data exchange in a gossip protocol, but also has other applications including synchronization of PDA databases and maintenance of routing tables in the face of host failures. Previous results have presented algorithms for set reconciliation that are nearly optimal in terms of communication complexity, but have computational complexity that is cubic in the number of differences. We present and analyze a novel algorithm that has expected computational and communication complexity that is linear in the number of differences between the sets being reconciled. We also provide experimental results from an implementation of this algorithm.
744|Using Voice to Generate Cryptographic Keys|In this position paper, we motivate and summarize our work on repeatably generating cryptographic keys from spoken user input. The goal of this work is to enable a device to generate a key (e.g., for encrypting files) upon its user speaking a chosen password (or passphrase) to it. An attacker who captures the device and extracts all information it contains, however, should be unable to determine this key. We outline our approach for achieving this goal and present preliminary empirical results for it. We also describe several directions for future work.
745|Scrambling Adversarial Errors Using Few Random Bits, Optimal Information Reconciliation, and Better Private Codes|When communicating over a noisy channel, it is typically much easier to deal with random,  independent errors with a known distribution than with adversarial errors. This paper looks at  how one can use schemes designed for random errors in an adversarial context, at the cost of  relatively few additional random bits and without using unproven computational assumptions.
746|Error correction in the bounded storage model|Abstract. We initiate a study of Maurers bounded storage model (JoC, 1992) in presence of transmission errors and perhaps other types of errors that cause different parties to have inconsistent views of the public random source. Such errors seem inevitable in any implementation of the model. All previous schemes and protocols in the model assume a perfectly consistent view of the public source from all parties, and do not function correctly in presence of errors, while the private-key encryption scheme of Aumann, Ding and Rabin (IEEE IT, 2002) can be extended to tolerate only a O(1 / log (1/e)) fraction of errors, where e is an upper bound on the advantage of an adversary. In this paper, we provide a general paradigm for constructing secure and error-resilient private-key cryptosystems in the bounded storage model that tolerate a constant fraction of errors, and attain the near optimal parameters achieved by Vadhans construction (JoC, 2004) in the errorless case. In particular, we show that any local fuzzy extractor yields a secure and error-resilient cryptosystem in the model, in analogy to the result of Lu (JoC, 2004) that any local strong extractor yields a secure cryptosystem in the errorless case, and construct efficient local fuzzy extractors by extending Vadhans sample-then-extract paradigm. The main ingredients of our constructions are averaging samplers (Bellare and Rompel, FOCS 94), randomness extractors (Nisan and Zuckerman, JCSS, 1996), error correcting codes, and fuzzy extractors (Dodis, Reyzin and Smith, EUROCRYPT 04). 1
747|Externalized Fingerprint Matching|The 9/11 tragedy triggered an increased interest in biometric  passports. According to several sources [2], the electronic ID market is  expected to increase by more than 50% per annum over the three coming  years, excluding China.
748|Reconciliation puzzles|We consider the problem of exchanging two similar strings held by different hosts with a minimum amount of communication. We reduce the problem of string reconciliation to a problem of multi-set reconciliation, for which nearly optimal solutions exist. Our approach involves transforming a string into a multi-set of substrings, which are reconciled efficiently and then put back together on a remote host using recent graph-theoretic results. We present an analysis of our algorithm to show that its communication complexity compares favorably to an existing method for string reconciliation. A version of this article will appear as: ¯ V. Chauhan and A. Trachtenberg, Reconciliation puzzles, IEEE Globecom 2004, Dallas, TX. I.
749|Fuzzy extractors|This chapter presents a general approach for handling secret biometric data in cryptographic applications. The generality manifests itself in two ways: we attempt to minimize the assumptions we make about the data, and to present techniques that are broadly applicable wherever biometric inputs are used. Because biometric data comes from a variety of sources that are mostly outside of anyones control, it is prudent to assume as little as possible about how they are distributed; in particular, an adversary may know more about a distribution than a systems designers and users. Of course, one may attempt to measure some properties of a biometric distribution, but relying on such measurements in the security analysis is dangerous, because the adversary may have even more accurate measurements available to it. For instance, even assuming that some property of a biometric behaves according to a binomial distribution (or some similar discretization of the normal distribution), one could determine the mean of this distribution only to within  1 v after taking n n samples; a well-motivated adversary can take more measurements, and thus determine the mean more accurately.
750|OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure|Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only traditional  clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.
751|Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations|The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called &#039;k-means, &#039; appears to give partitions which are reasonably
752|A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise|Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.
753|Automatic Subspace Clustering of High Dimensional Data|Data mining applications place special requirements on clustering algorithms including: the ability to find clusters embedded in subspaces of high dimensional data, scalability, end-user comprehensibility of the results, non-presumption of any canonical data distribution, and insensitivity to the order of input records. We present CLIQUE, a clustering algorithm that satisfies each of these requirements. CLIQUE identifies dense clusters in subspaces of maximum dimensionality. It generates cluster descriptions in the form of DNF expressions that are minimized for ease of comprehension. It produces identical results irrespective of the order in which input records are presented and does not presume any specific mathematical form for data distribution. Through experiments, we show that CLIQUE efficiently finds accurate clusters in large high dimensional datasets.
754|Efficient and Effective Clustering Methods for Spatial Data Mining|Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist implicitly in spatial databases. In this paper, we explore whether clustering methods have a role to play in spatial data mining. To this end, we develop a new clustering method called CLARANS which is based on randomized search. We also de- velop two spatial data mining algorithms that use CLARANS. Our analysis and experiments show that with the assistance of CLARANS, these two algorithms are very effective and can lead to discoveries that are difficult to find with current spatial data mining algorithms.
755|BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases|Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely st,udied problems in this area is the identification of clusters, or deusel y populated regions, in a multi-dir nensional clataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of 1/0 costs. This paper presents a data clustering method named Bfll (;H (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and clynamicall y clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i. e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a goocl clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few aclditioual scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposerl in the database area to handle noise)  (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively. We evaluate BIRCHS time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIR (;H versus CLARA NS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and S11OW that BIRCH is consistently 1
756|An Efficient Approach to Clustering in Large Multimedia Databases with Noise|Several clustering algorithms can be applied to clustering in large multimedia databases. The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing algorithms, however, is somewhat limited, since clustering in multimedia databases requires clustering high-dimensional feature vectors and since multimedia databases often contain large amounts of noise. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new algorithm to clustering in large multimedia databases called DENCLUE (DENsitybased CLUstEring). The basic idea of our new approachis  to model the overall point density analytically as the sum of influence functions of the data points. Clusters can then be identified by determining density-attractors and clusters of arbitrary shape can be easily described by a simple equation based on the overall density function. The advantages of our new approach are (1) it has a firm mathematical basis, (2) it has good clustering properties in data sets with large amounts of noise, (3) it allows a compact mathematical ...
757|Wavecluster: A multi-resolution clustering approach for very large spatial databases|Many applications require the management of spatial data. Clustering large spatial databases is an important problem which tries to find the densely populated regions in the feature space to be used in data mining, knowledge discovery, or efficient information retrieval. A good clustering approach should be efficient and detect clusters of arbitrary shape. It must be insensitive to the outliers (noise) and the order of input data. We pro-pose WaveCluster, a novel clustering approach based on wavelet transforms, which satisfies all the above requirements. Using multi-resolution property of wavelet transforms, we can effectively identify arbitrary shape clus-ters at different degrees of accuracy. We also demonstrate that WaveCluster is highly effi-cient in terms of time complexity. Experi-mental results on very large data sets are pre-sented which show the efficiency and effective-ness of the proposed approach compared to the other recent clustering methods.
758|A Fast Clustering Algorithm to Cluster Very Large Categorical Data Sets in Data Mining |Partitioning a large set of objects into homogeneous clusters is a fundamental operation in data mining. The k-means algorithm is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values limits its use in data mining because data sets in data mining often contain categorical values. In this paper we present an algorithm, called k-modes, to extend the k-means paradigm to categorical domains. We introduce new dissimilarity measures to deal with categorical objects, replace means of clusters with modes, and use a frequency based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. Tested with the well known soybean disease data set the algorithm has demonstrated a very good classification performance. Experiments on a very large health insurance data set consisting of half a million records and 34 categorical attributes show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of both the number of clusters and the number of records.  
759|Knowledge Discovery in Large Spatial Databases: Focusing Techniques for Efficient Class Identification|. Both, the number and the size of spatial databases are rapidly growing because of the large amount of data obtained from satellite images, X-ray crystallography or other scientific equipment. Therefore, automated knowledge discovery becomes more and more important in spatial databases. So far, most of the methods for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) have been based on relational database systems. In this paper, we address the task of class identification in spatial databases using clustering techniques. We put special emphasis on the integration of the discovery methods with the DB interface, which is crucial for the efficiency of KDD on large databases. The key to this integration is the use of a well-known spatial access method, the R*-tree. The focusing component of a KDD system determines which parts of the database are relevant for the knowledge discovery task. We present several strategies for focusing: selecting representatives from a spatial database, focusing on the re...
760|Pixel-oriented Database Visualizations|In this paper, we provide an overview of several pixel-oriented visualization techniques which have been developed over the last years to support an effective querying and exploration of large databases. Pixel-oriented techniques use each pixel of the display to visualize one data value and therefore allow the visualization of the largest amount of data possible. The techniques may be divided into query-independent techniques which directly visualize the data (or a certain portion of it) and query-dependent techniques which visualize the relevance of the data with respect to a specific query. An example for the class of query-independent techniques is the recursive pattern technique which is based on a generic recursive scheme generalizing a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for visualizing large databases. Examples for the class of query-dependent techniques are the generalized spiral and circle-segments techniques, which visualize the distances with respect to a database quer...
761|The BANG-Clustering System: Grid-Based Data Analysis|. For the analysis of large images the clustering of the data set is a common technique to identify correlation characteristics of the underlying value space. In this paper a new approach to hierarchical clustering of very large data sets is presented. The BANG-Clustering system presented in this paper is a novel approach to hierarchical data analysis. It is based on the BANG-Clustering method ([Sch96]) and uses a multidimensional grid data structure to organize the value space surrounding the pattern values. The patterns are grouped into blocks and clustered with respect to the blocks by a topological neighbor search algorithm. 1 Introduction  Clustering methods are extremely important for explorative data analysis, which is an important approach for the analysis of images. Previously presented algorithms can be divided into hierarchical algorithms, e.g. single-linkage, completelinkage, etc. and partitional algorithms, e.g. K-MEANS, ISODATA, etc. (see [DJ80]). All of these methods suf...
762|Learning Stochastic Logic Programs|Stochastic Logic Programs (SLPs) have been shown to  be a generalisation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs),  stochastic context-free grammars, and directed Bayes&#039;  nets. A stochastic logic program consists of a set of  labelled clauses p:C where p is in the interval [0,1] and  C is a first-order range-restricted definite clause. This  paper summarises the syntax, distributional semantics  and proof techniques for SLPs and then discusses how a  standard Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system,  Progol, has been modied to support learning of SLPs.  The resulting system 1) nds an SLP with uniform  probability labels on each definition and near-maximal  Bayes posterior probability and then 2) alters the probability  labels to further increase the posterior probability.  Stage 1) is implemented within CProgol4.5, which  differs from previous versions of Progol by allowing  user-defined evaluation functions written in Prolog. It  is shown that maximising the Bayesian posterior function  involves nding SLPs with short derivations of the  examples. Search pruning with the Bayesian evaluation  function is carried out in the same way as in previous  versions of CProgol. The system is demonstrated with  worked examples involving the learning of probability  distributions over sequences as well as the learning of  simple forms of uncertain knowledge.  
763|Knowledge Discovery in Databases: An Attribute-Oriented Approach|Knowledge discovery in databases, or data mining, is an important issue in the development of data- and knowledge-base systems. An attribute-oriented induction method has been developed for knowledge discovery in databases. The method integrates a machine learning paradigm, especially learning-from-examples techniques, with set-oriented database operations and extracts generalized data from actual data in databases. An attribute-oriented concept tree ascension technique is applied in generalization, which substantially reduces the computational complexity of database learning processes. Different kinds of knowledge rules, including characteristic rules, discrimination rules, quantitative rules, and data evolution regularities can be discovered efficiently using the attribute-oriented approach. In addition to learning in relational databases, the approach can be applied to knowledge discovery in nested relational and deductive databases. Learning can also be performed with databases containing noisy data and exceptional cases using database statistics. Furthermore, the rules discovered can be used to query database knowledge, answer cooperative queries and facilitate semantic query optimization. Based upon these principles, a prototyped database learning system, DBLEARN,  has been constructed for experimentation.
764|Querying Heterogeneous Information Sources Using Source Descriptions|We witness a rapid increase in the number of structured information sources that are available online, especially on the WWW. These sources include commercial databases on product information, stock market information, real estate, automobiles, and entertainment. We would like to use the data stored in these databases to answer complex queries that go beyond keyword searches. We face the following challenges: (1) Several information sources store interrelated data, and any query-answering system must understand the relationships between their contents. (2) Many sources are not full-featured database systems and can answer only a small set of queries over their data (for example, forms on the WWW restrict the set of queries one can ask). (3) Since the number of sources is very large, effective techniques are needed to prune the set of information sources accessed to answer a query. (4) The details of interacting with each source vary greatly. We describe the Information Manifold, an imp...
765|Answering queries using views|We consider the problem of computing answers to queries by using materialized views. Aside from its potential in optimizing query evaluation, the problem also arises in applications such as Global Information Systems, Mobile Computing and maintaining physical data independence. We consider the problem of nding a rewriting of a query that uses the materialized views, the problem of nding minimal rewritings, and nding complete rewritings (i.e., rewritings that use only the views). We show that all the possible rewritings can be obtained by considering containment mappings from the views to the query, and that the problems we consider are NP-complete when both the query and the views are conjunctive and don&#039;t involve built-in comparison predicates. We show that the problem has two independent sources of complexity (the number of possible containment mappings, and the complexity of deciding which literals from the original query can be deleted). We describe a polynomial time algorithm for nding rewritings, and show that under certain conditions, it will nd the minimal rewriting. Finally, we analyze the complexity of the problems when the queries and views may be disjunctive and involve built-in comparison predicates. 1
766|Retrieving And Integrating Datafrom Multiple Information Sources|With the current explosion of data, retrieving and integrating information  from various sources is a critical problem. Work in multidatabase systems  has begun to address this problem, but it has primarily focused on methods  for communicating between databases and requires significant effort for each  new database added to the system. This paper describes a more general  approach that exploits a semantic model of a problem domain to integrate  the information from various information sources. The information sources  handled include both databases and knowledge bases, and other information  sources (e.g., programs) could potentially be incorporated into the system.  This paper describes how both the domain and the information sources are  modeled, shows how a query at the domain level is mapped into a set of  queries to individual information sources, and presents algorithms for automatically  improving the efficiency of queries using knowledge about both the  domain and the informat...

768|Optimizing Queries with Materialized Views|While much work has addressed the problem of maintaining materialized views, the important question of optimizing queries in the presence of materialized views has not been resolved. In this paper, we analyze the optimization question and provide a comprehensive and efficient solution. Our solution has the desirable property that it is a simple generalization of the traditional query optimization algorithm. 1 Introduction  The idea of using materialized views for the benefit of improved query processing has been proposed in the literature more than a decade ago. In this context, problems such as definition of views, composition of views, maintenance of views [BC79, KP81, SI84, BLT86, CW91, Rou91, GMS93] have been researched but one topic has been conspicuous by its absence. This concerns the problem of the judicious use of materialized views in answering a query. It may seem that materialized views should be used to evaluate a query whenever they are applicable. In fact, blind applicat...
769|Data Model and Query Evaluation in Global Information Systems|. Global information systems involve a large number of information sources distributed over computer networks. The variety of information sources and disparity of interfaces makes the task of easily locating and efficiently accessing information over the network very cumbersome. We describe an architecture for global information systems that is especially tailored to address the challenges raised in such an environment, and distinguish our architecture from architectures of multidatabase and distributed database systems. Our architecture is based on presenting a conceptually unified view of the information space to a user, specifying rich descriptions of the contents of the information sources, and using these descriptions for optimizing queries posed in the unified view. The contributions of this paper include: (1) we identify aspects of site descriptions that are useful in query optimization; (2) we describe query optimization techniques that minimize the number of information source...
770|Answering queries using templates with binding patterns|When integrating heterogeneous information re-sources, it is often the case that the source is rather limited in the kinds of queries it can answer. If a query is asked of the entire system, we have a new kind of optimization problem, in which we must try to express the given query in terms of the lim-ited query templates that this source can answer. For the case of conjunctive queries, we show how to decide with a nondeterministic polynomial-time al-gorithm whether the given query can be answered. We then extend our results to allow arithmetic comparisons in the given query and in the tem-plates.
771|Query Caching and Optimization in Distributed Mediator Systems|Query processing and optimization in mediator systems that access distributed non-proprietary sources pose many novel problems. Cost-based query optimization is hard because the mediator does not have access to source statistics information and furthermore it may not be easy to model the source&#039;s performance. At the same time, querying remote sources may be very expensive because of high connection overhead, long computation time, financial charges, and temporary unavailability. We propose a costbased optimization technique that caches statistics of actual calls to the sources and consequently estimates the cost of the possible execution plans based on the statistics cache. We investigate issues pertaining to the design of the statistics cache and experimentally analyze various tradeoffs. We also present a query result caching mechanism that allows us to effectively use results of prior queries when the source is not readily available. We employ the novel invariants  mechanism, which s...
772|A Query Translation Scheme for Rapid Implementation of Wrappers|Wrappers provide access to heterogeneous information sources by converting application queries into source specific queries or commands. In this paper we present a wrapper implementation toolkit that facilitates rapid development of wrappers. We focus on the query translation component of the toolkit, called the converter. The converter takes as input a Query Description and Translation Language (QDTL) description of the queries that can be processed by the underlying source. Based on this description the converter decides if an application query is (a) directly supported, i.e., it can be translated to a query of the underlying system following instructions in the QDTL description; (b) logically supported, i.e., logically equivalent to a directly supported query; (c) indirectly supported, i.e., it can be computed by applying a filter,  automatically generated by the converter, to the result of a directly supported query. 1 Introduction  A wrapper or translator [C  +  94, PGMW95] is a s...
773|Distributed Active Catalogs and Meta-Data Caching in Descriptive Name Services|Today&#039;s global internetworks challenge the ability of name services and other information services to locate data quickly. We introduce a distributed active catalog and meta-data caching for optimizing queries in this environment. Our active catalog constrains the search space for a query by returning a list of data repositories where the answer to the query is likely to be found. Meta-data caching improves performance by keeping frequently used characterizations of the search space close to the user, and eliminating active catalog communication and processing costs. When searching for query responses, our techniques contact only the small percentage of the data repositories with actual responses, resulting in search times of a few seconds. We implemented a distributed active catalog and meta-data caching in a prototype descriptive name service called &#034;Nomenclator. &#034; We present performance results for Nomenclator in a search space of 1000 data repositories. 1. Introduction  Users canno...
774|Using Heterogeneous Equivalences for Query Rewriting in Multidatabase Systems|In order to have significant practical impact on future information systems, multidatabase management systems (MDBMS) must be both flexible and efficient. We consider a MDBMS with a common object-oriented model, based on the ODMG standard, and local databases that may be relational or object-oriented. In this context, query rewriting (for optimization) is made difficult by schematic discrepancy, and the need to model mapping information between the multidatabase and local schemas. We address the flexibility issue by representing the mappings from a local schema to the multidatabase schema, as a set of heterogeneous object equivalences, in a declarative language. Efficiency is obtained by exploiting these equivalences to rewrite multidatabase OQL queries into equivalent, simplified queries on the local schemas. 1 Introduction  The advent of open systems is increasingly stimulating the development of information systems which can provide high-level integration of heterogeneous informatio...
775|The Identification and Resolution of Semantic Heterogeneity in Multidatabase Systems|This paper describes several aspects of the  Remote--Exchange project at USC, which focuses on the controlled sharing and exchange of information among autonomous, heterogeneous database systems. The spectrum of heterogeneity which may exist among the components in a federation of database systems is examined, and an approach to accommodating such heterogeneity is described. An overview of the Remote--Exchange experimental system is provided. 1 Introduction  Consider an environment consisting of a collection of data/knowledge bases and their supporting systems, and in which it is desired to accommodate the controlled sharing and exchange of information among the collection. We shall refer to this as the (interconnected) autonomous heterogeneous database environment. Such environments are extremely common in various application domains, including office information systems, computer-integrated manufacturing systems (with computer-aided design as a subset), personal computing, business a...
776|View-Based and Modular Eigenspaces for Face Recognition|In this work we describe experiments with eigenfaces for recognition and interactive search in a large-scale face database. Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of o(10^3) faces. The problem of  recognition under general viewing orientation is also explained. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, in a eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demostrated. 
777|Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories |This paper presents a method for recognizing scene categories based on approximate global geometric correspondence. This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting spatial pyramid  is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralbas gist  and Lowes SIFT descriptors. 1.
778|Latent dirichlet allocation|We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model. 1.
779|Unsupervised Learning by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis|Abstract. This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known as Latent Semantic Analysis. In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.
780|Svm-knn: Discriminative nearest neighbor classification for visual category recognition|We consider visual category recognition in the framework of measuring similarities, or equivalently perceptual distances, to prototype examples of categories. This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech-101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(±0.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(±0.48%) at 30 training images. 1.
781|Context-Based Vision System for Place and Object Recognition|While navigating in an environment, a vision system has&#039; to be able to recognize where it is&#039; and what the main objects&#039; in the scene are. In this paper we present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is&#039; to identify familiar locations&#039; (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, Main Street), to categorize new environments&#039; (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextualpriors for object recognition (e.g., table, chair, car, computeD. We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and how such contextual information introduces strong priors&#039; that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors&#039; and outdoors&#039;) and to suggest the presence and locations&#039; of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides real-time feedback to the user.   1This work was sponsored by the Air Force under Air Force Contract F19628-00-C-0002.

782|Indoor-outdoor image classification|We show how high-level scene properties can be inferred from classification of low-level image features, specifically for the indoor-outdoor scene retrieval problem. We systematically studied the features: (1) histograms in the Ohta color space (2) multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters (3) coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of &#034;stacking.&#034; State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86 % performance, while the new method results in 90.3 % correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak.
784|Texture Orientation for Sorting Photos &#034;at a Glance&#034;|We investigate a measure of &#034;dominant perceived orientation &#034; that has recently been developed to match the output of a human study involving 40 subjects. The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven &#034;teaser&#034; images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a &#034;quick search&#034; problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brainpower to solve the image understanding problem, we conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. We demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely &#034;city/suburb&#034; shots. The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of 98 of the sce...
785|The Structure of Locally Orderless Images|We propose a representation of images in which a global, but not a local topology is defined. The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI&#039;s may contain many pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI&#039;s. This can be considered as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally, the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (&#034;inner scale&#034;), the extent of the ROI&#039;s (&#034;outer scale&#034;) and the resolution in the histogram (&#034;tonal scale&#034;). We describe how to construct locally orderless images, how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image processing operations.
786|Towards a Computational Model for Object Recognition in IT Cortex|  There is considerable evidence that object recognition in primates is based on the  detection of local image features of intermediate complexity that are largely invariant  to imaging transformations. A computer vision system has been developed that  performs object recognition using features with similar properties. Invariance to  image translation, scale and rotation is achieved by first selecting stable key points  in scale space and performing feature detection only at these locations. The features  measure local image gradients in a manner modeled on the response of complex  cells in primary visual cortex, and thereby obtain partial invariance to illumination,  affine change, and other local distortions. The features are used as input to  a nearest-neighbor indexing method and Hough transform that identify candidate  object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a best-fit  solution for the unknown model parameters and integrating the features consistent  with these parameter values. This verification procedure provides a model for the  serial process of attention in human vision that integrates features belonging to a  single object. Experimental results show that this approach can achieve rapid and  robust object recognition in cluttered partially-occluded images.   
787|An Overview of Workflow Management: From Process Modeling to Workflow Automation Infrastructure|  Todays business enterprises must deal with global competition, reduce the cost of doing business, and rapidly develop new services and products. To address these requirements enterprises must constantly reconsider and optimize the way they do business and change their information systems and applications to support evolving business processes. Workflow technology facilitates these by providing methodologies and software to support (i) business process modeling to capture business processes as workflow specifications, (ii) business process reengineering to optimize specified processes, and (iii) workflow automation to generate workflow implementations from workflow specifications. This paper provides a high-level overview of the current workflow management methodologies and software products. In addition, we discuss the infrastructure technologies that can address the limitations of current commercial workflow technology and extend the scope and mission of workflow management systems to support increased workflow automation in complex real-world environments involving heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed information systems. In particular, we discuss how distributed object management and customized transaction management can support further advances in the commercial state of the art in this area.
788|The Action Workflow approach to workflow management technology|This paper describes ActionWorkflowTM approach to workflow management technology: a design methodology and associated computer software for the support of work in organizations. The approach is based on theories of communicative activity as language faction and has been developed in a series of systems for coordination among users of networked computers. This paper describes the approach, gives an example of its application, and shows the architecture of a workflow management system based on it.
789|Managing Heterogeneous Multi-system Tasks to Support Enterprise-wide Operations|. The computing environment in most medium-sized and large enterprises involves old main-frame based (legacy) applications and systems as well as new workstation-based distributed computing systems. The objective of the METEOR project is to support multi-system workflow applications that automate enterprise operations. This paper deals with the modeling and specification of workflows in such applications. Tasks in our heterogeneous environment can be submitted through different types of interfaces on different processing entities. We first present a computational model for workflows that captures the behavior of both transactional and nontransactional tasks of different types. We then develop two languages for specifying a workflow at different levels of abstraction: the Workflow Specification Language (WFSL) is a declarative rulebased language used to express the application-level interactions between multiple tasks, while the Task Specification Language (TSL) focuses on the issues re...
790|Specification and Execution of Transactional Workflows|The basic transaction model has evolved over time to incorporate more complex transaction structures and to selectively modify the atomicity and isolation properties. In this chapter we discuss the application of transaction concepts to activities that involve coordinated execution of multiple tasks (possibly of different types) over different processing entities. Such applications are referred to as transactional workflows. In this chapter we discuss the specification of such workflows and the issues involved in their execution.  
791|Merging Application-centric and Data-centric Approaches to Support Transaction-oriented Multi-system Workflows|Workflow management is primarily concerned with dependencies between the tasks of a workflow, to ensure correct control flow and data flow. Transaction management, on the other hand, is concerned with preserving data dependencies by preventing execution of conflicting operations from multiple, concurrently executing tasks or transactions. In this paper we argue that many applications will be served better if the properties of transaction and workflow models are supported by an integrated architecture. We also present preliminary ideas towards such an architecture. 
792|Business process management with FlowMark|From an enterprise point of view the management of business processes is becoming increasingly important: Business processes control which piece of work will be performed by whom and which resources are exploited for this work, i.e. a business process describes how an enterprise will achieve its business goals. In this paper we sketch FlowMark (FlowMark is a trademark of IBM), an IBM program product supporting both, the modeling of business processes and their execution.
793|Using flexible transactions to support multi-system telecommunication applications|Service order provisioning is an important telecommunication application that automates the process of providing telephone services in response to the customer requests. It is an example of a multi-system application that requires access to multiple, independently developed application systems and their databases. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a prototype system 1 that supports the execution of the Flexible Transactions and its use to develop the service order provisioning application. We argue that such approach may be used to support the development of multi-system, flow-through processing applications in a systematic and organized manner. Its advantages include fast and easy specification of new services, support for testing of the declaratively specified work-flows, and the specification of potential concurrency among the tasks constituting an application.
